### What Brings You to Us Today? (Enquiry Details)

#### Primary Goal
Home renovations - updating the kitchen and fixing up the backyard/courtyard.

#### Other Goals
Not discussed

#### Client's Story
John and Emily are looking to renovate their home as their children are getting older. They want to update their kitchen, which John describes as "pretty dire" (06:07:33), and improve their backyard courtyard which is "a bit crap" (00:03:31). They have saved $50,000 specifically for this project and need to borrow an additional $150,000 to cover the estimated $200,000 cost. They've already spoken to a builder who provided this estimate and confirmed they won't need a DA for the internal and garden work. They're hoping to move quickly, planning to start within the next 2-3 months, and are concerned about minimizing the increase to their monthly repayments.
