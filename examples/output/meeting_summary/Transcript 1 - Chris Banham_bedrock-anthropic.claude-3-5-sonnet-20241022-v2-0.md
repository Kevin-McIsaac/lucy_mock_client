#### Client's Story
John and Emily are looking to renovate their home as their children are getting older. They have saved $50,000 specifically for this project and need to borrow an additional $150,000. The total renovation cost is estimated at $200,000 based on builder discussions. They want to proceed within the next 2-3 months and don't require council approval as it's internal work and garden improvements. As John states at [00:03:31]: "we think that it'll cost about 200,000. Like we spoke to a builder and they said that the kitchen and the stuff outside would would be about that." They're hoping to minimize the impact on their monthly repayments.
