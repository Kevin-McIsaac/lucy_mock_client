### What Brings You to Us Today? (Enquiry Details)

#### Primary Goal

The primary goal is to borrow an additional $150,000 for home renovations, specifically updating the kitchen and fixing the backyard/courtyard.

#### Other Goals

Not discussed

#### Client’s Story
John and Emily are looking to renovate their home because their kids are getting older and they want to update their living space, particularly the kitchen which is "pretty dire" (John Thompson, 00:07:33) and the "courtyard's a bit crap" (John Thompson, 00:02:31). They have $50,000 in savings they are happy to contribute, aiming to borrow an additional $150,000 to cover the estimated $200,000 renovation cost. Their main hope is that the renovations "won't cost us too much more in repayments" (John Thompson, 00:02:31). They want to move quickly, aiming to complete the process in the next two to three months, after finding a builder and confirming no DA is required for the internal and garden work. John also expressed interest in potentially adding solar if it fits the budget, though it's not currently planned.
