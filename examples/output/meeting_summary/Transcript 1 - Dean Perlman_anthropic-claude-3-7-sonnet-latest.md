Selling current property and purchasing a new home.

#### Other Goals
Building wealth through property investment.

#### Client's Story
Dylan owns a property currently valued around $420,000, which hasn't appreciated since purchase. He has renovated the bathroom, but the property hasn't grown in value as hoped. The broker advised selling this underperforming asset: "my opinion is get rid of it. Um it hasn't grown at all" (00:01:06). Dylan is looking to upgrade to a better property that will appreciate more over time, potentially a townhouse or house. The timing appears good as "Melbourne is going to start kicking off quite nicely over the coming years" (00:06:36). Dylan's partner has never purchased property before, but first home buyer benefits aren't applicable due to their joint application and income level.
