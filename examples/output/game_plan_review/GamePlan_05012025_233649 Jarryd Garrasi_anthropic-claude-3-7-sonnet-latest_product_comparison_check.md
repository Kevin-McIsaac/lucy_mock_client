# Product Comparison Check Template

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan recommends an ANZ Standard Variable 70%-80% (OO PI) loan at 5.96% with P&I repayments over 30 years. While this product is selected for its competitive rate compared to the client's current loan at 6.44%, the document shows higher-rate alternative options exist within the broker's research.

### Key Findings
- The selected ANZ variable rate (5.96%) is higher than ING's Orange Advantage (5.89%) which was presented as a comparison option
- Annual interest savings of approximately $2,700 from current lender are noted, but savings could be greater with the lower rate alternative
- The $10 monthly offset account fee with ANZ represents an additional cost not present with the ING option
- $2,000 cashback with ANZ is mentioned in rationale but not quantified against the long-term interest cost differential
- Total interest cost difference of $3,468.80 in favor of ING is shown but not sufficiently addressed in the recommendation rationale

## Detailed Product Analysis

### 1. Product Selection Overview
**Recommended Product**: ANZ *SP* Standard Variable 70%-80% (OO PI) at 5.96% p.a. with P&I repayments

**Compared Products**: 
- ING Orange Advantage Variable 70%-80% (OO PI) at 5.89% p.a.
- Member Package Variable 70%-80% (OO PI) at 5.94% p.a.

**Rate Differential Analysis**: The selected ANZ product has an interest rate 0.07% higher than the ING product (5.96% vs 5.89%) and 0.02% higher than the Member Package option (5.96% vs 5.94%).

### 2. Split Facility Consistency Assessment
**Consistency Across Splits**: Not applicable - the recommendation is for a single facility with no splits.

**Inconsistency Concerns**: Not applicable as there are no split facilities in this recommendation.

### 3. Interest Cost Comparison
**Interest Cost Calculation Period**: 30 years (as documented in the Game Plan)

**Recommended Product Total Cost**: $1,218,178.40 (total repayments and fees for ANZ product over 30 years)

**Alternative Product Total Cost**: $1,214,709.60 (total repayments and fees for ING product over 30 years)

**Cost Differential**: $3,468.80 in favor of the ING Orange Advantage product (the client would save this amount by selecting ING instead of ANZ)

### 4. Rationale Assessment
**Provided Rationale**: "ANZ has been selected as it offers the client a lower variable Rate of 5.96% on their loan saving them over $2,700 in interest payments during the first year plus A cashback of $2,000 is also applicable."

**Rationale Strength**: The rationale is inadequate as it focuses on savings compared to the client's current loan (6.44%) but fails to adequately address why ANZ was chosen over ING's lower 5.89% rate.

**Key Benefits Claimed**: 
- Lower rate than client's current loan (6.44% vs 5.96%)
- $2,000 cashback
- Offset account feature
- Flexibility of variable rate

**Benefit Quantification**: The document shows a $3,468.80 lifetime cost advantage with ING but does not quantify how the $2,000 cashback with ANZ offsets this difference. The value of other features (like offset account) is not quantified against the $10 monthly fee.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Product Comparison Enhancements
1. Include a clear explanation of why ANZ was selected despite ING's lower rate, with specific quantification of how the $2,000 cashback compensates for the higher lifetime interest cost
2. Provide a timeline analysis showing the break-even point where the higher rate begins to outweigh the initial cashback benefit
3. Include a more detailed comparison of product features between ANZ and ING to justify the selection of a higher-rate product

### Documentation Improvements
1. Include a side-by-side feature comparison table that highlights specific differences between products that benefit this client's unique situation
2. Document a net present value calculation that properly accounts for the time value of money when comparing upfront benefits against long-term costs

### Client Education Recommendations
1. Include a clear explanation to clients about the trade-off between upfront benefits (cashback) and long-term interest costs
2. Provide a simple calculator or timeline showing when the higher interest rate begins to outweigh the cashback benefit, allowing clients to make informed decisions based on their expected loan duration
