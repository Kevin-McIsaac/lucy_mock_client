# Application Data Check Template

## Executive Summary
The loan refinance application for Hannah Ahtuam and Justin Zahra has complete identification documentation and strong employment history but lacks full residential history prior to April 2021 and contains minor inconsistencies in employment details.

### Key Findings
* Both applicants' identification documents are valid until 2026, with no expiration concerns
* There is an incomplete residential history with no addresses documented prior to April 2021
* Employment verification for Hannah shows inconsistent contact details between sections
* Loan repayment on current mortgage ($3,634.47) differs from proposed new loan ($3,372.94)
* Credit card with high limit ($28,800) poses potential risk despite zero current balance

## Detailed Data Analysis

### 1. Identity Documentation
**ID Documents Provided**: Australian Drivers Licence (both applicants), Australian Passport (both applicants), Medicare Card (Justin only)

**Expiration Status**: All identification documents are valid until 2026 for Hannah, and 2026/2032 for Justin's documents. No documents are expired or nearing immediate expiration.

**Name Consistency**: Hannah's full name (Hannah Theadora Ahtuam) and Justin's full name (Justin John Zahra) are consistently used throughout the application.

**Missing Documentation**: No critical identification documents appear to be missing. Both applicants have provided primary and secondary identification.

### 2. Employment Verification
**Employment History**: 
- Hannah: Bunnings (Buyer, Full-Time, PAYG) - 01 Apr 2022 to Current
- Justin: DepEd - Creekside College (Teacher, Full-Time, PAYG) - 01 Feb 2020 to Current

**Employment Gaps**: No employment gaps are evident in the documented period, however, Hannah's employment history prior to April 2022 is not provided, which represents a potential gap in information.

**Employer Verification Concerns**: Hannah's employer contact information shows inconsistency - Bunnings location is listed as 570 Swan Street, Burnley but no ABN/ACN is provided. Contact person Belinda Rakers is provided with phone number.

**Income Documentation**: Income documentation appears complete with annual salary figures provided for both applicants (Hannah: $138,295 plus $15,000 car allowance; Justin: $90,154), but there is no mention of specific supporting documents such as payslips or tax returns.

### 3. Residential History
**Residential Timeline**: 
- 19 Harness Court, Sydenham VIC 3037 - May 2022 to Current
- 123 Hilma Street, Sunshine West VIC 3020 - April 2021 to May 2022

**Residential Gaps**: There is no residential history documented prior to April 2021, creating a significant gap in their residential timeline. Most lenders require 2-3 years of continuous residential history.

**Address Verification**: Current address verification appears straightforward as it matches their current mortgage property address, but previous address verification method is not specified.

**Stability Assessment**: The applicants show a relatively short residential stability of just over 2 years at their current address. The limited residential history documentation makes it difficult to fully assess their long-term stability.

### 4. Financial Information
**Account Documentation**: Multiple savings accounts are documented with specific account numbers and current balances. Both applicants have superannuation accounts with balance details.

**Missing Financial Data**: Payment histories for the existing mortgage with Great Southern Bank are not documented. There is no mention of bank statements or transaction histories provided as supporting documentation.

**Consistency Issues**: The current mortgage repayment ($3,634.47 monthly) differs from the proposed new loan repayment ($3,372.94 monthly), which aligns with the stated goal of refinancing to reduce costs.

### 5. Data Consistency Analysis
**Cross-Section Consistency**: The property value ($720,000) and loan amount ($565,000) are consistently referenced throughout the application. Personal contact information is consistent across sections.

**Timeline Coherence**: The property purchase timeline aligns with the residential history, showing the current property was acquired when they moved in (May 2022).

**Entity Verification**: Great Southern Bank is identified as the current lender but no details about verification of this entity are provided. Employer entities (Bunnings and DepEd - Creekside College) would benefit from ABN/ACN verification.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Data Completion Recommendations
* Obtain and document residential history for both applicants prior to April 2021 to establish a minimum 3-year continuous history
* Request confirmation of Hannah's employment history prior to April 2022 to establish continuous employment
* Request recent payslips and tax returns as supporting documentation for the income verification

### Verification Enhancements
* Verify Bunnings employer details with ABN lookup and confirm correct location and contact information for consistency

### Documentation Improvements
* Include detailed explanation of the purpose for the loan amount buffer ($565,000 requested vs $558,855.36 current loan) beyond the brief mention of "interest adjustments and fees"

## Verification Action Plan

### Immediate Verification Priorities
* Complete residential history for both applicants prior to April 2021
* Verify Hannah's employment with Bunnings including consistent contact information
* Document explanation for Justin's student loan with Victoria University and confirm repayment plan

### Secondary Verification Needs
* Confirm accuracy of high credit card limit ($28,800) for Hannah with zero current balance
* Verify insurance coverage through Great Southern Bank mentioned in the insurance declarations section

### Suggested Verification Methods
* Request 2-3 recent payslips from both applicants to verify current income
* Obtain rates notices or utility bills for address verification
* Conduct ABN/ACN lookup for both employers to verify business legitimacy
* Request 3 months of bank statements to verify income deposits and expense patterns
