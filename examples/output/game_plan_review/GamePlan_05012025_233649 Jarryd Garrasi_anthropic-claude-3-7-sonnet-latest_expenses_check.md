**Lifestyle Consistency**: Declared expenses align well with the clients' professional income level, metropolitan location, and couple-without-children household composition.

### 4. Responsible Lending Implications
**Expense Verification**: The Game Plan includes detailed expense breakdown across all major categories, indicating a comprehensive expense verification process.

**Serviceability Impact**: With monthly income of $20,287.42 and expenses of $5,447.33, there is substantial surplus income ($14,840.09) available for loan servicing before the proposed loan repayment of $3,372.94.

**Compliance Considerations**: The expense declarations appear compliant with responsible lending obligations, with comprehensive disclosure across all standard categories and reasonable allocations.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Expense Declaration Enhancements
1. Consider breaking down the "Recreational & Entertainment" category further to provide more granularity on the $1,527 monthly spend.
2. Include potential future expenses related to any planned major life changes (e.g., family planning, career changes).

### Verification Improvements
1. For the larger expense categories (groceries, recreation), consider including supporting documentation such as bank statements showing typical spending patterns.

### Documentation Upgrades
1. Add brief narrative explanations for any categories with significant month-to-month variation to demonstrate understanding of expense patterns.
