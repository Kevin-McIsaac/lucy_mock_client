# Expenses Check Template

## Executive Summary
Alexia's declared expenses of $2,417 monthly ($29,004 annually) appear somewhat low for a single professional earning $95,000 annually. While basic living costs are documented, some categories show minimal spending that may not fully reflect actual expenditure patterns.

### Key Findings
* Total declared expenses represent only 30.5% of gross income, below typical benchmarks for a single professional
* Several expense categories appear understated, particularly recreational spending and personal care
* No savings/investment allocation is explicitly documented despite strong income
* Transportation expenses appear reasonable but potentially understated for a vehicle owner
* Housing costs are currently limited to rental-related utilities and fees, but will increase significantly with new mortgage

## Detailed Expense Analysis

### 1. Client Profile and HEM Benchmark
**Client Demographics**: Alexia is a 39-year-old single professional with no dependents, working as an EA/Office Manager earning $95,000 annually. She lives in Malvern, Victoria (metropolitan Melbourne) and is purchasing her first home.

**Applicable HEM Benchmark**: For a single adult with high income in a metropolitan area, the applicable HEM benchmark range would be approximately $2,400-$2,900 monthly ($28,800-$34,800 annually).

**Declared Total Expenses**: $2,417 monthly ($29,004 annually)

**Benchmark Comparison**: Client's declared expenses appear to be at the lower end of the benchmark range, representing approximately 100% of the lower HEM benchmark.

### 2. Expense Category Analysis
**Expense Breakdown**:
- Groceries: $508/month
- Primary Residence Expenses: $641/month
- Insurance: $251.33/month
- Medical: $50/month
- Personal Care: $135/month
- Recreational & Entertainment: $385/month
- Telephone & Internet: $95/month
- Transport: $351.67/month

**Category Benchmark Comparison**:
- Groceries ($508/month): Slightly low but reasonable for a single adult
- Housing ($641/month): Currently low as it represents only utilities and body corporate fees, not rent or mortgage
- Transportation ($351.67/month): Reasonable for car ownership but may be understated
- Recreational ($385/month): Below typical spending for income level
- Personal Care ($135/month): Below average for a professional with this income level
- Insurance ($251.33/month): Appears adequate with health, contents, vehicle and pet insurance

**Notable Deviations**:
- No allocation for savings or investments despite having accumulated significant savings
- Recreational spending seems low for a single professional in Melbourne
- Personal care expenses appear minimal for a professional role
- No allocation for education, professional development, or holidays

**Missing Categories**:
- Regular savings or investment allocations
- Vacation/holiday expenses
- Education/professional development
- Cash withdrawals or miscellaneous spending
- Future home maintenance costs for new property

### 3. Anomaly Assessment
**Significant Underdeclarations**:
- Personal care at $135/month seems low for a professional in her field
- Recreational spending at $385/month appears modest for her income level and lifestyle
- No explicit allocation for holidays, gifts, or major discretionary purchases

**Significant Overdeclarations**:
- No categories appear significantly overdeclared

**Lifestyle Consistency**:
- The expense declaration suggests a very frugal lifestyle despite a strong income
- Client has accumulated significant savings ($103,428 across accounts) which indicates either undisclosed income or significant underspending historically
- The modest expense declaration is consistent with a strong savings focus but may not fully capture quality of life expenditures

**Justification Adequacy**:
- No explicit justifications are provided for the modest expense declarations
- The low expenses have enabled significant savings accumulation, but may not represent sustainable lifestyle costs

### 4. Responsible Lending Implications
**Expense Verification**: No evidence of expense verification is noted in the Game Plan. The expenses appear to be self-declared by the client.

**Serviceability Impact**: The low expense declaration significantly improves serviceability calculations. Monthly fortnightly loan repayments of $1,126.13 ($2,440 monthly equivalent) plus declared expenses of $2,417 total $4,857, representing 61.3% of gross monthly income.

**Compliance Considerations**: While the total expenses align with the lower end of HEM benchmarks, the allocation across categories raises questions about comprehensive expense capture. Reliance on these declarations without verification could pose compliance risks.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Expense Declaration Enhancements
1. Review personal care and recreational expenses to ensure they fully capture actual spending patterns for a professional in her income bracket
2. Add explicit allocations for savings/investments to reflect current behavior and future goals
3. Include anticipated home maintenance costs associated with property ownership

### Verification Improvements
1. Request 3-6 months of bank and credit card statements to verify spending patterns across declared categories
2. Compare transaction evidence against declared expenses to identify any gaps or understatements

### Documentation Upgrades
1. Document the transition plan from current expenses to post-settlement expenses, including how mortgage repayments will impact discretionary spending
2. Include a buffer for unexpected household expenses related to new property ownership
