### **Exit Strategy Overview**
*Version: v0.1, 22-May-2025, Jason*

The "Game Plan" provides a good foundation for addressing legislative requirements; however, several areas could be enhanced to demonstrate more robust adherence and transparency for borrowers.

*   **National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (NCCP Act) & Responsible Lending Guidelines:**
    *   **Issue:** The primary concern relates to the long-term sustainability of the loan repayments, particularly given John (born 12-Jun-1985) and Emily (born 25-Sep-1987) both plan to retire at age 65, while the proposed 30-year loan term will see John turn 69 and Emily turn 67 before the loan is fully repaid.
    *   **Improvement:** While "Downsizing home" is stated as the proposed repayment method post-retirement, the current document does not detail the assessment of this strategy's viability under various economic conditions, nor does it outline any contingency plans. To fully satisfy responsible lending obligations and demonstrate the loan is "not unsuitable," the Game Plan should explicitly:
        *   Detail the assumed value of the property at retirement and the equity position.
        *   Discuss the potential risks associated with relying solely on downsizing (e.g., market downturns, difficulty selling, personal desire to remain in the home).
        *   Outline alternative or supplementary repayment strategies for the post-retirement period (e.g., superannuation drawdown capacity, investment income, reduced living expenses) to demonstrate continued capacity to meet obligations without substantial hardship.
        *   Include a clear statement confirming that the broker has made reasonable inquiries and verified the feasibility of the stated exit strategy, or noted any unmitigated risks.

*   **Best Interests Duty (BID):**
    *   **Issue:** While the document explicitly states the broker's commitment to BID and provides a rationale for the chosen product, the "Other Information Preferences - Not Specified" and "Any other requirements and objectives? No" sections (page 8) could imply that a deeper exploration of the clients' broader financial objectives or potential future needs beyond the immediate loan purpose may not have occurred or been documented.
    *   **Improvement:** To further strengthen the demonstration of BID, the broker could briefly confirm that discussions extended to other financial goals (e.g., investment property aspirations, future debt consolidation not covered by this refinance, wealth creation strategies) and how the current loan structure aligns or does not conflict with these, even if they are outside the direct scope of credit assistance. This ensures all relevant aspects of the clients' financial situation have been considered.

*   **Australian Credit Licence (ACL) Conditions & Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guides:**
    *   **Current Standing:** The document clearly states the broker's ACL (Loan Market Pty Ltd, ACL No: 390222) and mentions awareness of ASIC Regulatory Guides (e.g., Design and Distribution Obligations and Target Market Determinations). The level of detail in the Game Plan regarding fees, commissions, and product comparisons demonstrates a good understanding of disclosure requirements.
    *   **Improvement:** No specific issues are identified that require immediate remediation based on the provided text, but continuous review of new or updated ASIC Regulatory Guides is essential.

*   **Privacy Act 1988 & Australian Privacy Principles (APPs):**
    *   **Current Standing:** The "Collection notice for privacy purposes & consent" (page 30) is comprehensive, detailing data collection, usage, disclosure (including overseas), access rights, and the complaints process. Consent for electronic communication and signatures is also clearly sought.
    *   **Improvement:** This section appears robust and compliant. No specific improvements are identified.

*   **Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act):**
    *   **Issue:** The AML/CTF Act is mentioned as a legislative obligation (page 10), and client identification details (Drivers Licence, Passport) are noted. However, the document does not explicitly state how identity verification has been or will be conducted in accordance with AML/CTF obligations.
    *   **Improvement:** A brief statement confirming that identity verification (Customer Due Diligence) will be undertaken in line with AML/CTF requirements, whether by the broker or by the lender, would provide clearer transparency on this compliance aspect.

*   **Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (FSR Act):**
    *   **Current Standing:** The document explicitly disclaims providing legal and/or financial advice (page 31), clearly delineating the scope of service as credit assistance under the NCCP Act rather than financial product advice under the FSR Act.
    *   **Improvement:** No specific issues are identified given the clear disclaimer.

*   **Dispute Resolution Requirements:**
    *   **Issue:** While the "Privacy Policy" refers to a "complaints process" (page 30), which is part of internal dispute resolution (IDR), the document does not explicitly state the broker's membership in an approved external dispute resolution (EDR) scheme.
    *   **Improvement:** Clearly stating the broker's membership with an approved EDR scheme (e.g., Australian Financial Complaints Authority - AFCA) and providing contact details for that scheme would ensure full compliance with dispute resolution obligations and provide borrowers with clear avenues for recourse.

*   **Industry Codes of Conduct:**
    *   **Issue:** The document's emphasis on Best Interests Duty and transparent practices aligns with the principles of industry codes. However, it does not explicitly state which specific industry code of conduct (e.g., those from the MFAA or FBAA) the broker adheres to.
    *   **Improvement:** Explicitly mentioning adherence to a recognised industry code of conduct and the associated professional body (e.g., "As a member of [Industry Association], I adhere to their Code of Practice...") would further enhance client confidence and transparency.
