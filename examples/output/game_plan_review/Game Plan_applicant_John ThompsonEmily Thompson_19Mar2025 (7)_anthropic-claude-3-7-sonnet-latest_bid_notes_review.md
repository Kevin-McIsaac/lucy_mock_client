**Approach**  
We have assessed over 30 lenders in the market and narrowed this down to 5 lenders who are the most suitable options considering your needs and financial position. Your primary goal is to refinance your existing CBA loan of $800,000 and access $150,000 for renovations to your kitchen, outdoor area, and add an extra bedroom to increase your home's value and functionality. Your preferences include competitive rates, minimal fees, strong customer service, with specific interest in Bank Australia, Bank of Sydney, and ING. You've also indicated a desire to complete your renovations by June 2025, with a target settlement date of August 1, 2025.

**Recommendation**  
After careful analysis, we recommend refinancing with Bank Australia, with a total lending amount of $923,672 structured as a split loan:
- Split 1: $423,672 as a variable rate loan at 5.13% p.a. (Clean Energy Home Loan Renovate Variable <90% OO PI), with initial monthly repayments of $2,308.14
- Split 2: $500,000 as a fixed rate loan at 4.84% p.a. for 3 years (Clean Energy Home Loan Renovate 3 Years Fixed <90% OO PI), with initial monthly repayments of $2,635.43
- Combined initial monthly repayments of $4,943.57

This solution includes funds to pay out your existing CBA mortgage ($800,000), clear your Macquarie car loan ($22,000), cover legal fees ($1,000), registration fees ($171.70), lender fees ($850), and provide the $150,000 for your planned renovations.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This solution aligns perfectly with your goals and objectives in several ways:

1. **Competitive Interest Rates**: Bank Australia's rates (5.13% variable and 4.84% fixed) are more competitive than your current CBA rate of 5.20%, saving you money immediately. The split structure balances the benefits of a lower fixed rate (for certainty) with a variable portion (for flexibility).

2. **Ethical Banking Alignment**: Bank Australia was one of your preferred lenders due to their ethical banking practices and strong customer service reputation, which matches your preferences.

3. **Offset Account Feature**: The variable portion comes with an offset account, providing flexibility to access funds while reducing interest when not in use â€“ perfect for your renovation plans.

4. **Access to Required Funds**: The loan structure provides the exact $150,000 needed for your renovations plus covers the costs of refinancing and clearing your car loan, streamlining your debt.

5. **Timing Alignment**: The solution can be implemented well before your target date of August 2025, ensuring you can proceed with renovations as planned.

6. **Renovation Support**: Bank Australia's Clean Energy Home Loan specifically supports environmentally sustainable renovations, which can add further value to your property.

**Compared Products**  
We compared several other lenders and products:

1. **ING's Mortgage Simplifier Variable** (5.89% p.a.): While ING was on your preferred list, their rate is 0.76% higher than Bank Australia's variable rate, which would result in approximately $6,565 more in costs over the life of the loan compared to our recommendation.

2. **Bank of Sydney's Offset Package Variable** (5.94% p.a.): Another of your preferred lenders, but their rate is 0.81% higher than Bank Australia's variable rate, resulting in approximately $19,040 more in lifetime costs. Additionally, they charge a $248 ongoing annual fee, increasing your costs further.

3. **Westpac's Standard Variable** (5.99% p.a.): Offers a higher rate than Bank Australia and charges a $10 monthly fee, resulting in approximately $19,662 more in costs over the loan term.

4. **Macquarie's MAV Package Variable** (6.05% p.a.): The highest rate among compared products, with a $395 annual fee, resulting in approximately $34,032 more in lifetime costs compared to our recommendation.

For the fixed rate portion, Bank Australia's 3-year fixed rate of 4.84% was significantly better than alternatives from ING (5.59%), Bank of Sydney (5.65%), Westpac (5.74%), and Macquarie (5.74%). These competitors would result in $10,276 to $210,405 more in lifetime costs.

While ING offers slightly lower fees, the substantial rate difference makes Bank Australia the clear best-interest choice for your situation.

**Fees and charges**  
The Bank Australia solution has minimal fees compared to alternatives:
- $350 total upfront fee
- No ongoing monthly fees
- No application fees
- No valuation fees
- No discharge fees

By comparison, other lenders had various combinations of fees including annual package fees (up to $395 with Macquarie), monthly account fees, and discharge fees, adding to their overall cost. The Bank of Sydney Offset Package includes a $248 annual fee, while Macquarie charges $395 annually.

The recommended Bank Australia solution not only offers the lowest interest rates but also has among the lowest fee structures of all compared products, providing you with the best overall value and aligning with your preference for minimal fees.
