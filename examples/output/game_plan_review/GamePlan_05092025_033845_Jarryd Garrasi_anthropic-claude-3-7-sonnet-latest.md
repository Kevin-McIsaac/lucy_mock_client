# Game Plan Review

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan lacks critical details for full compliance with BID obligations, including insufficient explanation of interest rate choices, inadequate product comparison details, and missing information about why NAB specifically meets Alexia's best interests compared to alternatives.

### Final Recommendations
* Provide specific interest rate comparisons between NAB and alternative lenders with exact savings calculations.
* Include detailed explanation of offset account costs compared to package fees with specific dollar amounts saved.
* Clarify if First Home Guarantee Scheme eligibility was verified and explain exact LMI savings amount.
* Explain the specific benefits of the split loan structure with calculations showing the client impact.
* Document clear reasoning for the 30-year loan term recommendation versus shorter terms.

### Next Steps
* Revise the Game Plan addressing all recommendations prior to client signature
* Ensure documentation of three product options includes specific financial comparisons
* Verify client eligibility for First Home Guarantee Scheme before proceeding
* Provide specific calculations showing long-term interest savings from proposed structure
* Schedule follow-up with client to review revised Game Plan

## Top 5 Recommendations for Game Plan Compliance

### Recommendation: Quantify Interest Rate Competitiveness

**Issue**: The Game Plan fails to quantify how NAB's interest rates specifically compare to alternatives in the market.

**Fix**: Add specific interest rate data showing NAB's 5.39% fixed and 5.99% variable rates compared to at least 2 other lenders' rates for the same loan structure. Calculate exact monthly savings (e.g., "NAB's rates save Alexia $X per month compared to CBA's 5.45%/6.10% and $Y compared to Westpac's 5.55%/6.15% for an identical split loan").

### Recommendation: Specify First Home Guarantee Scheme Benefits

**Issue**: The document mentions LMI savings but lacks specific calculations and verification of Alexia's eligibility.

**Fix**: Include verification of Alexia's First Home Guarantee Scheme eligibility with income test results. Calculate the exact LMI premium savings: "By qualifying for the FHGS with NAB, Alexia will avoid a $5,432 LMI premium that would be required on a $435,000 loan (85.29% LVR) without the scheme, representing a direct saving compared to non-scheme lenders."

### Recommendation: Detail Offset Account Cost Benefits

**Issue**: Claims that NAB's $8/month offset fee is better than competitors' annual package fees lack supporting calculations.

**Fix**: Add specific comparison: "NAB's $8/month offset fee ($96/year) saves Alexia $299 annually compared to Commonwealth Bank's $395 annual package fee and $249 compared to ANZ's $345 package fee. Over the first 5 years of the loan, this represents $1,495 in direct savings while providing identical offset functionality."

### Recommendation: Justify Split Loan Structure

**Issue**: The rationale for the specific 50/50 split between variable and fixed portions lacks detailed justification.

**Fix**: Add specific rationale: "The recommended 50/50 split structure ($220,000 variable/$215,000 fixed) provides optimal balance between rate certainty and flexibility. If interest rates fall 0.25% during the fixed term, Alexia benefits on the variable portion saving approximately $550/year, while remaining protected from rate increases on the fixed portion. This structure aligns with her stated need for both repayment certainty and flexibility."

### Recommendation: Clarify Product Feature Benefits

**Issue**: The document mentions offset and redraw features but fails to quantify the benefits specific to Alexia's financial situation.

**Fix**: Add calculations demonstrating feature benefits: "Based on Alexia's current savings of $103,428.41, placing these funds in NAB's offset account would reduce her effective loan balance to $331,571.59, saving approximately $5,574 in interest annually and potentially reducing her loan term by 6 years and 2 months if maintained throughout the loan term."
