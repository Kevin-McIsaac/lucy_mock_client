# Game Plan Review 

## Executive Summary
This Game Plan lacks critical details to justify why the recommended NAB split loan with fixed and variable rates is in Alexia's best interests. The rationale is repetitive, fails to quantify advantages over other options, and contains contradictory interest rate information.

### Final Recommendations
* Include quantitative comparisons showing specific dollar savings compared to alternatives.
* Fix contradictory interest rate information between rationale (5.99%/5.39%) and product comparison (5.39%/5.99%).
* Explain how the First Home Guarantee Scheme specifically benefits Alexia beyond LMI savings.
* Provide more specific details about offset account benefits with actual calculations.
* Develop a clearer explanation of split loan benefits tailored to Alexia's situation.

### Next Steps
* Review and correct all interest rate information for consistency
* Strengthen rationale with specific calculations showing dollar savings
* Add specific details about how features align with Alexia's financial position
* Provide clearer explanations about retirement planning alignment

## Top 5 Recommendations for Game Plan Compliance

### Recommendation: Fix Interest Rate Inconsistencies

**Issue**: The Game Plan presents contradictory interest rate information between the rationale section and product comparison tables.

**Fix**: Update all rate references to be consistent throughout the document. Page 2 indicates Split 1 is 5.39% while page 4 states 5.99%. Similarly, Split 2 shows 5.39% on page 2 but later mentions 5.39% fixed then 5.99% variable. Ensure all rate information matches the actual offers.

### Recommendation: Quantify Financial Benefits of NAB Recommendation

**Issue**: The rationale lacks specific calculations demonstrating why NAB's offer is superior to other lenders considered in the comparison.

**Fix**: Add a comparison table showing that NAB's $8/month offset fee ($96/year) saves Alexia $299 annually compared to the $395 package fee from alternative lenders. Calculate the exact LMI savings of "over $5,000" to show precisely how much the First Home Guarantee Scheme will save. Show monthly repayment differences between NAB and competitors.

### Recommendation: Strengthen First Home Guarantee Details

**Issue**: The document repeatedly mentions the First Home Guarantee Scheme but fails to properly explain eligibility requirements or processes.

**Fix**: Include specific details about the First Home Guarantee Scheme requirements including: maximum property value for Victoria ($850,000), confirmation that Alexia meets the income threshold (under $125,000), explanation of the application process, and clarification that this isn't just LMI savings but enables lower deposit (5% vs 20%) while avoiding LMI.

### Recommendation: Provide Clear Offset Account Calculations

**Issue**: The Game Plan mentions offset benefits but doesn't quantify how this feature specifically benefits Alexia given her $80,000 savings.

**Fix**: Add calculations showing if Alexia places $50,000 in her offset account against the variable portion ($220,000), she would save approximately $2,695 in interest in the first year and reduce her loan term by X years. Include how this supports her goal of paying off the loan before retirement at 67 (currently 41 years away).

### Recommendation: Address Serviceability for Retirement Planning

**Issue**: The Game Plan mentions term alignment with retirement strategy but lacks specific explanation of how the 30-year term aligns with Alexia's retirement at age 67.

**Fix**: Add a section explaining that Alexia is currently 39 years old with planned retirement at 67, meaning the 30-year loan term would extend 2 years beyond retirement. Include her stated strategy of using superannuation lump sum to clear remaining balance, noting her current super balance of $75,954 and how this is projected to grow to approximately $X by retirement age based on current contributions.
