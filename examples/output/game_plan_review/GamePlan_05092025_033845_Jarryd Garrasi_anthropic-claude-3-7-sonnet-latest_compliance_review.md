## Capture Objectives

- **Was there a detailed description of the client's requirements, objectives explaining why the client wanted these requirements?** The Game Plan does not provide detailed information on why the client wanted these specific requirements beyond basic statements like "minimizing monthly repayment" and "fitting in with retirement strategy."

- **Are there at least 2 forms of clear and legible identification documents on file?** There are 3 forms of ID mentioned (Driver's License, Medicare Card, and Passport) but no evidence they have been verified or that clear copies are on file.

- **Is there evidence of enquiries into the client's current income documented and verified?** While income is listed, there's no evidence of verification through supporting documents like payslips.

- **Is there evidence of enquiries into the client's current liabilities documented and verified?** The only liability shown is AfterPay with a $0 balance and $3,000 limit, but there's no evidence of verification through supporting documents.

- **Is there evidence that all documents to support the application have been uploaded to MyCRM?** There's no mention of supporting documents being uploaded to MyCRM.

## Best Interests Duty

- **Is there evidence of a product comparison with a minimum of 3 lender or product comparisons?** The comparison only shows products from one lender (NAB) with different features, not a comparison across multiple lenders.

- **Has an affordability assessment been completed?** While there's income and expense information, there's no formal affordability assessment showing serviceability calculations.

## Recommendations Chat

- **Are there detailed notes on how the client's needs and objectives have been met through the lender and product selection and how this meets the client's best interests?** The explanation lacks sufficient detail about how NAB specifically meets the client's needs better than other lenders beyond mentioning the First Home Guarantee Scheme.

- **Are there notes explaining which specific product features meet the client's needs and objective, including the cost and benefits of these features (where applicable)?** The notes about product features are generic and don't clearly link to the client's specific needs and circumstances.

## Lodge The Deal

- **Were all Tax File Numbers and Customer Reference Numbers removed from the supporting documents?** There's no mention of TFNs or CRNs being removed from supporting documents.
