# Financials Consistency Check

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan shows good financial consistency with a well-documented loan structure for a first home purchase, featuring balanced funding sources against requirements. Only a minor deficit of $241.90 is identified, which is negligible relative to the overall transaction.

### Key Findings
* The funding structure shows a minor deficit of $241.90 between available funds ($515,000) and required funds ($515,241.90)
* Total loan amount ($435,000) is split between variable ($220,000 at 5.99%) and fixed ($215,000 at 5.39%) components
* Client contribution from savings is $80,000, which represents 15.53% of the purchase price
* Post-settlement retained funds of approximately $20,000 are documented for furnishing the new home
* The financial structure aligns with the client's documented goal of obtaining a first home under the First Home Guarantee Scheme

## Detailed Financial Analysis

### 1. Funding Structure Overview
**Transaction Components**: 
- Purchase price: $510,000.00
- Mortgage registration fees: $131.90
- Transfer fees: $1,302.00
- Legal fees: $1,800.00
- Lender upfront fees: $500.00
- Other fees: $1,500.00
- Lenders fees: $8.00
- Total funds required: $515,241.90

**Funding Sources**: 
- Client savings: $80,000.00
- Proposed lending (variable P&I at 5.39%): $220,000.00
- Proposed lending (fixed P&I at 5.39%): $215,000.00
- Total funds available: $515,000.00

**Funding Balance**: 
- Deficit: $241.90 (difference between total funds required and available)

### 2. Mathematical Consistency Assessment
**Deposit Calculation**: The deposit amount of $80,000 represents 15.53% of the purchase price of $510,000, with the remainder ($430,000) being 84.31% of the purchase price which is covered by the loan plus an additional $5,000 for transaction costs.

**Costs Calculation**: The total costs (excluding purchase price) sum to $5,241.90, which is accurately calculated and included in the total funds required.

**Overall Balance**: Total funds required ($515,241.90) slightly exceed total funds available ($515,000.00), resulting in a minor deficit of $241.90 (approximately 0.05% of the transaction).

**Inconsistencies Identified**: A minor discrepancy exists in the interest rate documentation - Split 1 is described as having a 5.39% variable rate on page 4 but as 5.99% in the goals section on page 2. Later comparison tables confirm 5.39% is the correct rate for both splits.

### 3. Funding Imbalance Analysis
**Shortfall Assessment**: A minor funding shortfall of $241.90 exists, representing approximately 0.05% of the total transaction. No specific explanation is provided for this deficit, but given its small size, it could easily be covered by the client's savings.

**Surplus Assessment**: There is no funding surplus. However, the Game Plan notes that "The client will have some minimally retained funds post settlement of approximately $20,000- this is to help her establish the New Home with household furniture etc." This indicates planned use of additional savings beyond the documented $80,000 contribution.

**Imbalance Explanation Adequacy**: The minor deficit is not specifically explained, but is negligible in the context of the overall transaction. The documentation of retained funds for home furnishing provides clarity on the client's broader financial planning beyond the immediate transaction.

### 4. Financial-Goals Alignment
**Stated Client Objectives**: 
- Purchase a first home using the First Home Guarantee Scheme
- Obtain a total loan of $435,000 split between variable and fixed components
- Structure the loan over 30 years to align with retirement strategy and minimize monthly repayments
- Use principal and interest repayments with fortnightly frequency to minimize interest and build equity
- Utilize offset account to reduce interest and provide access to funds
- Include redraw facility for access to prepaid funds

**Financial Structure Alignment**: The financial structure strongly aligns with these objectives. The loan is structured exactly as specified with the desired splits, features, and term. The First Home Guarantee Scheme is utilized to avoid LMI costs, which is explicitly identified as important to the client. The repayment structure matches the client's goals for building equity while maintaining manageable payments.

**Misalignments Identified**: No significant misalignments between the financial structure and client objectives were identified.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Financial Consistency Enhancements
1. Clarify the interest rate discrepancy - the Game Plan states 5.99% for Split 1 (variable) in the goals section but shows 5.39% in other sections. Consistent documentation would improve clarity.
2. Explicitly address the minor funding deficit of $241.90 with a clear source for covering this amount, even though it's a negligible amount in the context of the overall transaction.

### Funding Imbalance Resolution
1. Document the exact amount of additional savings the client has available beyond the $80,000 contribution to provide clarity on total financial resources available for both the property purchase and post-settlement furnishing needs.

### Goal Alignment Improvements
1. Include more specific information about the client's retirement strategy and how the 30-year loan term specifically aligns with this, providing greater context for this aspect of the financial structure.
