## Top 5 Recommendations for Game Plan Compliance

### Recommendation: Reconcile conflicting interest rate information

**Issue**: The Game Plan contains contradictory statements about the current and proposed interest rates that undermine the rationale for refinancing.

**Fix**: Update recommendation rationale to consistently state Great Southern Bank's current rate is 6.44% and ANZ's proposed rate is 5.96% (not 5.93%), with precise calculated annual interest savings of $2,802.31 based on a $565,000 loan amount. Include comparison to ING's option at 5.89% showing the dollar value trade-off for selecting ANZ.

### Recommendation: Accurately describe offset account costs and benefits

**Issue**: Offset account costs are inconsistently represented as both $10 monthly and "$0" in different sections of the document.

**Fix**: Clearly state throughout the document that ANZ charges $10 monthly for the offset account feature, totaling $120 annually. Calculate and show the interest savings potential based on Hannah and Justin's current savings of $29,870 if placed in the offset account, demonstrating annual interest savings of approximately $1,780 would outweigh the $120 annual fee.

### Recommendation: Resolve client data inconsistencies in document

**Issue**: Client financial information is presented inconsistently throughout the document, including loan amount discrepancies.

**Fix**: Ensure all client information is consistently presented, particularly updating the rationale section where it states "re-finance an existing loan of $000,000.00 currently held with (BANK)" to correctly show "$558,855.36 currently held with Great Southern Bank" and maintain consistency with this information throughout the entire document.

### Recommendation: Provide clear Best Interest Duty comparison

**Issue**: The document lacks specific comparisons between the recommended ANZ product and alternative lenders to demonstrate compliance with BID requirements.

**Fix**: Add a comparison table showing ANZ (5.96%, $3,372.94/month) vs. ING (5.89%, $3,347.61/month) vs. Great Southern Bank (current 6.44%, $3,634.47/month). Calculate 5-year interest savings with ANZ ($15,693) vs staying with Great Southern, and explain why the $2,000 cashback offsets ING's slightly lower rate over the near term.

### Recommendation: Complete the recommendation rationale

**Issue**: The rationale is missing several required elements including specific product features, turnaround times, and credit policy considerations.

**Fix**: Expand the rationale to address all BID requirements: 1) Add ANZ's specific turnaround times for refinance applications (e.g., "typically 10 business days versus market average of 15"); 2) Detail relevant credit policy advantages (e.g., "ANZ's policy accepts 100% of Justin's Teacher's allowance while other lenders only take 80%"); 3) Explain borrowing capacity differences between lenders with specific figures.
