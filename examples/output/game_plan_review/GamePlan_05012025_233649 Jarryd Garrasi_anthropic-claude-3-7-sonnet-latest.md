# Game Plan Review

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan lacks critical details to support Best Interests Duty compliance, particularly around interest rate comparisons, property valuation evidence, affordability calculations, and clear explanation of recommendations. Specific client situations are insufficiently addressed.

### Final Recommendations
* Add quantified interest rate comparisons showing exact savings from refinancing to ANZ
* Include specific affordability calculations demonstrating loan serviceability
* Document evidence of property valuation supporting the 78.47% LVR calculation
* Provide clear explanation of the client-specific benefits of the 30-year loan term
* Enhance recommendation rationale with specific calculations showing short and long-term benefits

### Next Steps
* Review and update the recommendation rationale with specific savings calculations
* Add documentation confirming property valuation supporting LVR calculations
* Include detailed serviceability calculations demonstrating loan affordability
* Clarify explanation of why the 30-year term meets client's retirement strategy
* Document client awareness of increased total interest over longer loan term


## Top 5 Recommendations for Game Plan Compliance

### Recommendation: Include Specific Interest Rate Comparison and Savings

**Issue**: The Game Plan mentions saving "in excess of $2,700 per year" without providing exact calculations or comparison to alternative lenders.

**Fix**: Add exact calculations showing current GSB rate of 6.44% on $558,855.36 compared to ANZ's 5.96%, resulting in monthly savings of $261.53 ($3,634.47 vs. $3,372.94) and annual savings of $3,138.36. Include comparative interest savings against ING's 5.89% ($25.33/month) and ME Bank's 5.94% ($7.24/month) over 5 years.

### Recommendation: Document Evidence of Valuation Supporting LVR

**Issue**: The 78.47% LVR calculation relies on a $720,000 property valuation without documented evidence of how this valuation was determined.

**Fix**: Add a statement confirming "Property valuation of $720,000 for 19 Harness Court, Sydenham was determined through [formal valuation method] completed on [date]. This valuation supports the calculated LVR of 78.47% which qualifies for the ANZ product without requiring LMI."

### Recommendation: Add Detailed Affordability Calculations

**Issue**: The Game Plan lacks specific affordability calculations demonstrating the clients can service the loan given their income and expenses.

**Fix**: Include a calculation showing "Monthly net income of $20,287.42 minus expenses of $5,447.33 leaves $14,840.09 available for loan repayments. The recommended ANZ loan requires monthly repayments of $3,372.94, representing 16.6% of gross income and 22.7% of available funds, demonstrating strong serviceability."

### Recommendation: Clarify Retirement Strategy Alignment

**Issue**: The Game Plan mentions the 30-year term fits with "retirement strategy" without explaining how this aligns with clients' ages (Hannah 30, Justin 31) and stated retirement age of 65.

**Fix**: Add "The 30-year loan term aligns with Hannah and Justin's stated retirement age of 65. With Hannah currently 30 and Justin 31, the loan will be fully amortized by their retirement. Their intention to make additional repayments through the offset account will further reduce the principal before retirement."

### Recommendation: Document Client Understanding of Term Extension

**Issue**: The Game Plan mentions extending from a 27-year to 30-year term without adequately documenting client understanding of increased total interest costs.

**Fix**: Include specific statement: "Clients understand that extending from current 27-year remaining term to a new 30-year term will increase total interest paid by approximately $31,540 over the life of the loan. However, they prioritize immediate monthly savings of $261.53 with flexibility to make additional repayments through the offset account to reduce the principal faster if their financial situation improves."
