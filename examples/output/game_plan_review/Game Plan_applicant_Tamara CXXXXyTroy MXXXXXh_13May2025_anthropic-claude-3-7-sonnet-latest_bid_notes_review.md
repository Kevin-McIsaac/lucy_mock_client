**Approach**  
We have assessed over 30 lenders in the market and narrowed this down to 4 lenders who are the most suitable option considering your needs and financial position. Tamara and Troy, your primary goal is to consolidate your existing personal debts into a single home loan, along with obtaining additional funds to pay for your children's dental work. Your objective is to streamline your finances and reduce financial stress, while addressing your family's immediate health needs. Your preferences include finding a solution that works despite past credit issues, with the aim of rebuilding your credit score over the next 12 months so you can eventually transition to a first-tier lender.

**Recommendation**  
After careful consideration, we recommend a Liberty home loan with a total lending amount of $328,000 over a 30-year term. This will be structured as a single variable rate loan at 6.24% p.a., with initial monthly repayments of $2,017.42. This solution not only consolidates your existing Bluestone mortgage of $287,116.24 but also incorporates your various personal debts (Latitude Personal Loan of $1,456.63, Westpac credit card of $9,746.78, NAB credit card of $2,441.51, and Afterpay balance of $1,625). Additionally, it covers all associated fees and provides approximately $22,166 of surplus funds which can be used for your children's dental work.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This recommendation aligns perfectly with your goal of debt consolidation and simplifying your financial situation. Given your previous credit issues from 2023 that still appear on your credit file, many first-tier lenders would not be suitable options at this time. Liberty's Near Prime product offers an appropriate solution that acknowledges your current financial circumstances while providing competitive terms.

The variable rate structure is particularly suitable as you've indicated this is a short-term lending arrangement (approximately 12 months) while you work on improving your credit score. The consolidation of multiple debts into a single loan simplifies your financial management and potentially reduces your overall monthly repayment obligations. The additional funds provided will address your immediate need for your children's dental work, helping you avoid taking on additional high-interest debt for these expenses.

**Compared Products**  
We compared several near-prime lenders who could accommodate your credit history and consolidation needs, including Bluestone, Liberty, Go Flexi, and Pepper. While all four met your basic requirements, Liberty emerged as the clear best choice for several reasons:

1. Liberty offers the lowest interest rate at 6.24% p.a., compared to Bluestone Essential Prime at 6.29%, Go Beyond at 6.68%, and Pepper Prime at 6.79%. This difference results in monthly savings and significantly lower lifetime costs.

2. When comparing total lifetime costs (including all fees and interest), Liberty is $7,480 cheaper than the next best option (Bluestone), $34,466 cheaper than Go Beyond, and $48,355 cheaper than Pepper Prime.

3. Liberty's upfront fee of $995 is competitive compared to other options: Bluestone ($929), Go Beyond ($1,450), and Pepper ($1,110).

4. Liberty has no ongoing monthly fees, while some competitors charge $10-15 per month.

5. Liberty offers a fast turnaround time of just three business days, which helps you address your immediate needs more quickly.

Though Bluestone's upfront fee is slightly lower ($929 vs. Liberty's $995), the higher interest rate (6.29% vs. 6.24%) means significantly higher overall costs over the loan term. The difference in lifetime cost between Liberty and Bluestone is $7,480, clearly demonstrating that Liberty provides better long-term value despite the marginally higher upfront fee.

**Fees and charges**  
The Liberty home loan includes an application fee of $995 payable at settlement, and a discharge fee of $395 when you eventually exit the loan. There are no ongoing monthly or annual fees. 

When comparing to alternative lenders, Liberty's fee structure is very competitive. Bluestone charges a slightly lower application fee ($929) but a higher discharge fee ($500), Go Beyond has much higher upfront costs ($1,450) with a $300 discharge fee, and Pepper has both high upfront fees ($1,110) and discharge fees ($500), plus an ongoing monthly fee of $15.

Given that you plan to refinance after approximately 12 months when your credit score improves, Liberty's combination of competitive upfront fees, no ongoing fees, and the lowest interest rate makes it the most cost-effective solution for your situation. This recommendation clearly supports your best interest by providing the lowest overall cost solution that meets all your requirements and aligns with your short and long-term financial goals.
