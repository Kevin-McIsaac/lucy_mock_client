# Product Comparison Check

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan recommends a split loan with NAB featuring a variable rate at 5.99% and a 3-year fixed rate at 5.39%. The broker's rationale focuses on the First Home Guarantee Scheme eligibility and $8/month offset fee, but contains significant inconsistencies in rate information and inadequate quantified comparison of alternatives.

### Key Findings
* Inconsistent interest rates are presented throughout the document (5.39% vs 5.99% for variable portion)
* The variable rate product selected (5.99%) has a higher rate than comparable options (5.93% and 5.43%)
* The comparison shows NAB variable rate as both 5.39% and 5.99% in different sections
* Cost differentials between selected and alternative products are not adequately quantified in the rationale
* Alternative lender comparisons lack detailed feature/benefit analysis to justify higher rate selection

## Detailed Product Analysis

### 1. Product Selection Overview
**Recommended Product**: NAB split loan: Split 1 - Tailored Variable (70-80% LVR, Owner Occupied, P&I) at 5.99% p.a.; Split 2 - Tailored 3 Years Fixed (70-80% LVR, Owner Occupied, P&I) at 5.39% p.a.

**Compared Products**: 
- Option 2 (Split 1): Offset Home Loan Variable 70-80% (OO P&I) at 5.93% p.a.
- Option 3 (Split 1): Offset Variable 70-80% (OO P&I) at 6.04% p.a.
- Option 2 (Split 2): Offset Home Loan 3 Years Fixed 70-80% (OO P&I) at 5.44% p.a.
- Option 3 (Split 2): Standard 2 Years Fixed <95% (OO P&I) at 5.79% p.a.

**Rate Differential Analysis**: For Split 1, the selected variable product (5.99%) is 0.06% higher than Option 2 (5.93%) and 0.05% lower than Option 3 (6.04%). For Split 2, the selected fixed rate product (5.39%) is 0.05% lower than Option 2 (5.44%) and 0.40% lower than Option 3 (5.79%). However, there is inconsistency in the document as the variable rate is shown as both 5.39% and 5.99%.

### 2. Split Facility Consistency Assessment
**Consistency Across Splits**: The same competitor lenders appear to be compared across both splits (though they are not explicitly named beyond "Option 2" and "Option 3"), maintaining some consistency in the comparison.

**Inconsistency Concerns**: The major inconsistency is the variable rate presented for Split 1, which is shown as 5.39% in the solution summary but 5.99% in the product comparison section. This creates confusion about the actual recommended rate and undermines the comparison's reliability. The recommended lender is consistently NAB, but the rate inconsistency makes proper comparison impossible.

### 3. Interest Cost Comparison
**Interest Cost Calculation Period**: 30 years (as specified in the client's goals)

**Recommended Product Total Cost**: Using the rates from the product comparison section: 
- Split 1 ($220,000 at 5.99%): $447,471.20
- Split 2 ($215,000 at 5.39% fixed for 3 years, then 5.99% variable): $458,731.26
- Total interest cost: $906,202.46

**Alternative Product Total Cost**: Using Option 2 which has lower rates:
- Split 1 ($220,000 at 5.93%): $482,133.80
- Split 2 ($215,000 at 5.44% fixed for 3 years, then 5.93% variable): $456,649.44
- Total interest cost: $938,783.24

**Cost Differential**: The recommended NAB product appears to be $32,580.78 less expensive than Option 2 over the 30-year term, but this calculation is compromised by inconsistent rate information in the document.

### 4. Rationale Assessment
**Provided Rationale**: The main rationale provided is eligibility for the First Home Guarantee Scheme which saves over $5,000 in LMI costs, and the $8/month offset fee compared to an annual fee of $395 with other lenders. The rationale also mentions flexibility with repayments on the variable portion and certainty on the fixed portion.

**Rationale Strength**: The rationale is inadequate to justify the selection, particularly given the inconsistent rate information. While the First Home Guarantee Scheme is a valid consideration, the $5,000 LMI saving is not quantified against potential higher interest costs from a higher rate product. The $8/month vs $395/year fee comparison ($96 vs $395 annually) provides some justification but isn't quantified against total interest costs.

**Key Benefits Claimed**: Access to First Home Guarantee Scheme, lower monthly offset account fee compared to annual package fees, flexibility with extra repayments on variable portion, certainty with fixed repayments on fixed portion.

**Benefit Quantification**: Benefits are poorly quantified. The LMI saving of "over $5,000" is mentioned but not weighed against potential higher interest costs. The annual fee saving ($299) is implied but not explicitly calculated or compared against interest differentials. The document fails to quantify how these benefits offset potentially higher interest costs over the loan term.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Product Comparison Enhancements
1. Ensure consistent and accurate interest rate information throughout the document to enable proper comparison between products.
2. Quantify the long-term cost impact of the First Home Guarantee Scheme against alternative lenders that may offer lower interest rates but require LMI.
3. Present a detailed, side-by-side comparison of all product features across the compared lenders, not just interest rates, to demonstrate comprehensive assessment of alternatives.

### Documentation Improvements
1. Clearly identify the competing lenders by name rather than just "Option 2" and "Option 3" to demonstrate a broader market assessment.
2. Include detailed calculations showing how the claimed benefits (LMI savings, lower fees) offset any higher interest costs over the life of the loan.

### Client Education Recommendations
1. Provide a clear explanation of the total cost of credit over the life of the loan for the recommended product and alternatives, helping the client understand the long-term financial implications.
2. Explicitly discuss the trade-off between the First Home Guarantee Scheme benefits and potentially lower interest rates available from other lenders not participating in the scheme.
