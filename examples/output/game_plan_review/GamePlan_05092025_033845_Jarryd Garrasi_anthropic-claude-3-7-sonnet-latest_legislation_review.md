### **Exit Strategy Overview**

Based on a review of the Game Plan Data Set, here are the key legislative considerations that should be addressed:

**National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (NCCP Act) & Responsible Lending Guidelines:**
The exit strategy relies on Alexia's retirement at age 67 and using a superannuation lump sum to repay the loan. Given she is currently 39 (born 1986) and the loan term is 30 years, there is a potential misalignment as the loan would mature when she is 69, which is beyond her stated retirement age. The broker should ensure that the loan term aligns with Alexia's retirement plans and that there is a clear understanding of how the loan will be serviced between retirement age and loan maturity.

**Best Interests Duty (BID):**
While NAB has been selected for its First Home Guarantee Scheme offering, there appears to be a discrepancy in the interest rates mentioned. In one section, Split 1 is listed at 5.99% variable and Split 2 at 5.39% fixed, but in the product comparison sections, Split 1 shows 5.39% variable and Split 2 shows 5.39% fixed (first 3 years) then 5.99% variable. This inconsistency requires clarification to ensure Alexia fully understands the terms and rates applied to her loan.

**Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Regulatory Guides:**
The document mentions the borrower has arrears-related questions answered with "No" but doesn't provide clear evidence of a detailed serviceability assessment. To comply with ASIC RG 209, more information should be included about Alexia's ability to meet loan repayments after retirement, especially since her stated exit strategy relies on a superannuation lump sum at age 67.

**Privacy Act 1988 & Australian Privacy Principles (APPs):**
While consent for information collection is included at the end of the document, it would be beneficial to ensure Alexia understands how her personal and financial information will be used and stored, particularly given the detailed nature of the information collected.

**Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act):**
The document contains proper identification verification with Alexia's driver's license, Medicare card, and passport information, which aligns with AML/CTF requirements. However, more details on the source of the $80,000 deposit would strengthen AML/CTF compliance.

**Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (FSR Act):**
There are sections referring to insurance and financial advice referrals, but clarification is needed regarding whether these services are provided under appropriate licensing arrangements and whether there was adequate disclosure of any conflicts of interest or commissions received.

**Industry Codes of Conduct:**
The broker has provided the required disclosures about commission structures and clawback provisions, which aligns with industry codes of conduct. However, more transparency regarding the selection of NAB over other First Home Guarantee Scheme lenders would strengthen the demonstration of adherence to industry codes.

Key considerations that should be addressed include:
1. Clarification of the loan term and alignment with retirement plans
2. Consistent information about interest rates across all documentation
3. More detailed assessment of post-retirement serviceability
4. Clear explanation of how the superannuation lump sum will be sufficient to cover the loan balance at retirement
5. Verification of the source of the $80,000 deposit
