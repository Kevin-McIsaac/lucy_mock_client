# Style Check Template

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan document displays inconsistent writing quality with several areas of concern including grammatical errors, inconsistent terminology, and formatting issues. While the core financial information is present, the document's overall professionalism is compromised by these stylistic issues.

### Key Findings

* Inconsistent formatting of financial figures and percentages
* Unclear explanations of key financial concepts in some sections
* Repetitive content in the recommendation rationale section
* Inconsistent capitalization and spacing throughout the document

## Detailed Style Analysis

### 1. Tone and Professionalism
**Overall Tone Assessment**: The document generally maintains a professional tone appropriate for financial documentation, but this is undermined in several sections by grammatical errors and casual phrasing.

**Professionalism**: The level of professionalism varies throughout the document. While financial information is presented comprehensively, the delivery lacks polish in several sections, particularly in the "Goals and Objectives" sections.

**Formality Consistency**: There are noticeable shifts in formality throughout the document. Some sections use appropriately formal financial language while others contain more casual phrasing and sentence fragments.

**Specific Tone Issues**: The "Selected product & recommendation rationale continued..." section contains redundancies and shifts between third-person and second-person address, creating inconsistency in how the client is referenced.

### 2. Language and Terminology
**Terminology Consistency**: Financial terms are not used consistently throughout the document. For example, "offset account" appears variously as "offset account," "Offset Account," and "offset facility."

**Clarity of Expression**: Several passages lack clarity, particularly in explaining complex financial concepts. The explanation of rate preferences and fixed/variable loan splits contains run-on sentences that may confuse clients.

**Client-Friendly Language**: While most of the document attempts to use accessible language, some sections contain industry jargon without adequate explanation, such as "net of offset" and "clawback."

**Industry-Specific Terms**: Terms like "LMI," "P&I," and "scheme" are used without complete explanation on first mention, potentially confusing clients without financial expertise.

### 3. Spelling and Grammar
**Spelling Errors**: 
- "accomodation" instead of "accommodation"
- "ts" instead of "fits" in several places
- "o " instead of "off" in multiple instances
- "owing" instead of "paying off" in recommendation rationale

**Grammatical Issues**: 
- Multiple sentence fragments throughout, particularly in the "Your goals" section
- Subject-verb agreement errors in several paragraphs
- Inconsistent use of possessive apostrophes
- Run-on sentences in the recommendation rationale section

**Punctuation Problems**: 
- Inconsistent use of commas in lists
- Missing periods at the end of several bullet points
- Inconsistent use of hyphens in compound modifiers
- Asterisks used for emphasis without consistent formatting

**Formatting Consistency**: 
- Inconsistent formatting of percentages (sometimes with % symbol, sometimes with "p.a.")
- Dollar amounts sometimes include cents, sometimes do not
- Inconsistent spacing after periods and between sections
- Bullet points and numbered lists formatted differently throughout document

### 4. Document Structure and Flow
**Narrative Coherence**: The document generally presents a coherent narrative about the client's financial situation, but repetition in the recommendation rationale section disrupts the flow.

**Logical Progression**: While information generally follows a logical sequence, some details appear in multiple sections with slightly different wording, creating confusion.

**Transitional Elements**: Transitions between sections are abrupt in some areas, particularly between the goals section and solution summary.

**Overall Readability**: Overall readability is compromised by formatting inconsistencies and grammatical errors, making it more difficult for clients to absorb important financial information.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Tone and Professionalism Enhancements
1. Standardize client reference throughout the document, consistently using either second-person ("you") or third-person ("the client") references, but not alternating between them.
2. Remove redundant statements in the recommendation rationale section and ensure each point provides unique, valuable information.
3. Avoid sentence fragments by ensuring each statement has a subject and verb, particularly in the "Your goals" section.

### Language and Clarity Improvements
1. Create a glossary of key financial terms used throughout the document, ensuring terms like "LMI," "offset account," and "redraw" are clearly defined on first mention.
2. Break down complex explanations into shorter, more digestible sentences, particularly in sections explaining fixed and variable rate features.
3. Ensure consistent capitalization of key terms throughout the document (e.g., "offset account" vs. "Offset Account").

### Spelling and Grammar Corrections
1. Correct all instances of "ts" to "fits" and "o " to "off" throughout the document.
2. Fix sentence fragments in the "Your goals" section by providing complete sentences with subjects and verbs.
3. Ensure consistent use of apostrophes in possessive forms (e.g., "client's" vs. "clients").
4. Standardize the format for percentages, consistently using either "5.39%" or "5.39% p.a." but not alternating between formats.

### Document Flow Optimization
1. Eliminate repetition between the initial goals section and the recommendation rationale section, ensuring information is presented only once with consistent wording.
2. Improve transitions between sections with brief introductory sentences that connect the previous section to the upcoming content.

## Before and After Examples

### Example 1: Sentence Fragments and Punctuation
**Original Text**: "Term required is 30 years as it ts in with the retirement strategy as well as minimizing the monthly repayment."

**Improved Version**: "A 30-year term is required as it fits in with the retirement strategy and minimizes the monthly repayment amount."

### Example 2: Inconsistent Terminology and Redundancy
**Original Text**: "Features: O set account has been selected to allow access to funds, the aim to use this account to help reduce the amount of interest payable on the loan and help pay it o sooner as well as shortening the loan term if they continue to build savings into this account"

**Improved Version**: "Features: An offset account has been selected to allow access to funds while reducing the amount of interest payable on the loan. This will help pay off the loan sooner and shorten the loan term as savings continue to build in this account."

### Example 3: Repetitive Content
**Original Text**: "A 30 year loan term and P *I repayments have been selected to build on the equity in the property and reduce the debt as quickly as possible. A variable rate loan has been chosen as this o ers the  exibility to make extra repayments without being penalized with the goal of paying owing the loan Prior to retirement- this is why a  xed rate Product was not suitable and did not meet the needs."

**Improved Version**: "A 30-year loan term with Principal and Interest (P&I) repayments has been selected to build equity in the property and reduce debt quickly. The variable rate portion provides flexibility for extra repayments without penalties, supporting the goal of paying off the loan prior to retirement."
