### **Exit Strategy Overview**

Based on a review of the Game Plan Data Set, here are the key legislative considerations that need to be addressed:

**1. National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (NCCP Act) & Responsible Lending Guidelines**
* The data shows the borrowers are refinancing to a 30-year loan term when they currently have 27 years remaining. While this improves cash flow, it could result in higher total interest over the life of the loan. The broker has noted this concern but should quantify the impact more clearly to ensure borrowers fully understand the long-term costs.
* The exit strategy is not explicitly detailed for borrowers who will be 61 (Hannah) and 62 (Justin) at loan maturity, which requires specific consideration under responsible lending obligations.

**2. Best Interests Duty (BID)**
* The recommendation focuses heavily on interest rate savings ($2,700 per year) and cashback ($2,000), but doesn't fully explore other options that might better meet the clients' long-term financial interests, especially considering retirement planning.
* The broker has selected a variable rate loan with an offset account, which aligns with the clients' stated preferences, but the document contains inconsistent information about why this is in their best interests.

**3. Privacy Act 1988 & Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)**
* The document properly outlines consent requirements for collection and handling of personal information, including the potential for overseas disclosure.
* Electronic signature and document delivery consents are properly obtained.

**4. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act)**
* The document references collecting standard identification documents (driver's licenses, passports, Medicare card) which is appropriate for KYC requirements.
* However, there's no mention of source of funds verification or ongoing monitoring obligations.

**5. Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (FSR Act)**
* The broker appropriately discloses commissions and compensation arrangements, including initial payment (0.715% of the loan amount) and ongoing monthly payments (0.22% of the outstanding balance).
* The clawback provisions are clearly explained, helping clients understand the broker's incentive structure.

**6. ASIC Regulatory Guides**
* The document appears to follow disclosure requirements for credit assistance providers, but could more thoroughly document the comparison of alternative products.
* The product comparison section shows only three options, all from the same lender (ANZ), which may not reflect a comprehensive market assessment.

**7. Industry Codes of Conduct**
* The data indicates the broker has conducted a needs analysis, but there are inconsistencies in how the recommendations align with the clients' long-term objectives, particularly regarding retirement planning.
* The broker discloses their obligation to act in the client's best interests, but the analysis of how the specific product recommendation fulfills this obligation could be more robust.

**8. Dispute Resolution Requirements**
* The document doesn't clearly outline the available dispute resolution processes if clients are dissatisfied with the broker's services or the recommended product.

**Primary Concerns:**
1. The lack of a clearly documented exit strategy for borrowers approaching retirement age during the loan term
2. Limited product comparison across multiple lenders
3. Insufficient quantification of the long-term financial impact of extending the loan term from 27 to 30 years
