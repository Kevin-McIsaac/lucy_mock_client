# Style Check Template

## Executive Summary
The Game Plan for Hannah and Justin's mortgage refinancing contains several spelling, grammar, and consistency issues that detract from its professional appearance. While the document conveys the essential information, improvements in terminology consistency, formatting standardization, and correction of mechanical errors would significantly enhance its professional quality.

### Key Findings
* Inconsistent spacing and formatting throughout the document
* Multiple spelling errors including "fee's" instead of "fees" and inconsistent capitalization 
* Alignment issues and formatting inconsistencies in tables and bullet points
* Awkward sentence structures in several explanatory sections
* Inconsistent terminology when referring to the same financial concepts

## Detailed Style Analysis

### 1. Tone and Professionalism
**Overall Tone Assessment**: The document generally maintains a professional tone appropriate for financial documentation, though it occasionally shifts to an overly casual approach in some sections, particularly in the explanation of loan preferences.

**Professionalism**: The professionalism of the document is undermined by mechanical errors, inconsistent formatting, and occasional awkward phrasing that suggests hasty composition rather than careful financial advising.

**Formality Consistency**: The level of formality fluctuates throughout the document. The sections explaining fees and commissions maintain appropriate formality, while sections explaining the clients' preferences and rationale shift to a more conversational tone.

**Specific Tone Issues**: The rationale for recommendation section contains run-on sentences and shifts between formal explanation and casual justification. The section beginning with "They seek approval to refinance..." contains a mixture of precise financial information and informal phrasing that creates an inconsistent voice.

### 2. Language and Terminology
**Terminology Consistency**: Financial terms are used inconsistently. For example, the document alternates between "offset account" and "offset" and uses both "principal and interest" and "PI" without establishing the abbreviation.

**Clarity of Expression**: Several sections contain unclear expressions that could confuse clients, particularly in the explanation of why the recommended solution is in the client's best interest, where multiple concepts are combined into run-on sentences.

**Client-Friendly Language**: While the document generally uses accessible language, some explanations of financial concepts are either too technical or too simplified to be truly helpful to clients without financial expertise.

**Industry-Specific Terms**: Terms like "LVR," "GSB," and "clawback" are used without adequate explanation in some instances, though other sections do provide appropriate context for these terms.

### 3. Spelling and Grammar
**Spelling Errors**: 
- "fee's" instead of "fees" 
- "bu er" instead of "buffer"
- "di erence" instead of "difference"
- "re nance" instead of "refinance" (appears multiple times)
- "o ers" instead of "offers"
- "o set" instead of "offset"

**Grammatical Issues**: 
- Subject-verb agreement errors, such as "a cashback of $2,000 are also applicable"
- Run-on sentences throughout the rationale section
- Missing articles before nouns in multiple instances
- Inconsistent use of tense, particularly when describing the clients' preferences

**Punctuation Problems**: 
- Inconsistent use of periods at the end of bullet points
- Missing commas in complex sentences
- Inconsistent spacing after punctuation
- Improper formatting of dollar amounts (sometimes with space after $ and sometimes without)

**Formatting Consistency**: 
- Inconsistent spacing throughout tables and between sections
- Inconsistent use of capitalization for terms like "Offset Account" vs. "offset account"
- Inconsistent numerical formatting (sometimes with commas for thousands and sometimes without)
- Irregular alignment in tables and lists

### 4. Document Structure and Flow
**Narrative Coherence**: The document attempts to tell a coherent story about the clients' situation and needs, but this narrative is disrupted by formatting issues and disconnected explanations.

**Logical Progression**: The information generally follows a logical sequence from goals to solution to explanation, but connection between sections could be strengthened.

**Transitional Elements**: Transitions between major sections are abrupt with limited signposting to help clients understand how different pieces of information relate to each other.

**Overall Readability**: Readability is compromised by formatting inconsistencies, spacing issues, and lengthy, complex sentences, particularly in explanatory sections.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Tone and Professionalism Enhancements
1. Standardize the tone throughout the document to maintain a consistently professional but approachable voice, particularly in the rationale and explanation sections.
2. Review all client-specific information for accuracy and consistent presentation, ensuring explanations maintain a respectful, professional tone while clearly explaining financial concepts.

### Language and Clarity Improvements
1. Create a terminology glossary for consistent use of financial terms throughout the document; standardize terms like "offset account" and ensure abbreviations are properly introduced.
2. Break down complex explanations into shorter, clearer sentences, particularly in the rationale section explaining why the recommendation is in the client's best interest.

### Spelling and Grammar Corrections
1. Correct all identified spelling errors, particularly focusing on financial terms and consistent spacing.
2. Fix grammatical issues, especially subject-verb agreement and run-on sentences.
3. Review and correct all punctuation, ensuring consistent use of commas, periods, and spacing.
4. Standardize formatting of dollar amounts, percentages, and numerical values throughout.

### Document Flow Optimization
1. Add clear transitional statements between major sections to help clients understand how different pieces of information relate to the overall recommendation.
2. Ensure consistent formatting of similar elements (tables, bullet points, headings) to improve visual flow and readability.
