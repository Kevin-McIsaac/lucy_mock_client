### **Exit Strategy Overview**
*Version: v0.1, 22-May-2025, Jason*

Based on review of the Game Plan Data Set, several key compliance considerations emerge:

**NCCP Act & Responsible Lending**
- Both borrowers plan to retire at age 65 during the 30-year loan term (John currently 40, Emily 38)
- Exit strategy relies on downsizing the property
- Assessment needed of whether downsizing is viable based on:
  - Current property value ($1.2M) vs loan amount ($923,672)
  - Local property market conditions
  - Future property values
  - Retirement income sources

**Best Interests Duty (BID)**
- Split loan structure recommended ($423,672 variable @ 5.13% and $500,000 fixed @ 4.84%)
- Need to clearly document why this structure best serves client's interests vs alternatives
- Justification needed for lender selection (Bank Australia) over client preferences (ING, Bank of Sydney)

**ACL Conditions & ASIC Guidelines**
- Current income and expenses documented
- Foreseeable changes to circumstances addressed
- Insurance coverage confirmed
- Fixed rate break costs and product limitations disclosed

**Privacy & AML/CTF**
- Client consent obtained for information collection/sharing
- ID verification completed (Driver's License for John, Passport for Emily)
- Electronic signature consent obtained
- Privacy policy and notices provided

**Recommendations**
1. Document detailed assessment of exit strategy viability
2. Include sensitivity analysis for property values/retirement income
3. Obtain more detail on superannuation balances/projections 
4. Consider lower LVR or shorter loan term to reduce risk
5. Review insurance coverage adequacy
6. Strengthen rationale for recommended product structure

The current Game Plan provides a reasonable foundation but would benefit from enhanced focus on exit strategy documentation and verification to fully satisfy regulatory requirements.
