# Application Data Check Template

## Executive Summary
Application data for Alexia Ligonnet's mortgage shows mostly complete information with sufficient employment and financial details. However, there are gaps in residential history prior to March 2019 and potential concerns about employment stability due to recent job changes.

### Key Findings
* Recent employment change (started new role in October 2024) with a previous 3-month job gap
* Residential history only documented from March 2019, lacking required comprehensive 2-3 year history
* Missing specific contact information for previous employers
* Potential verification challenge with recent employment change
* Strong financial position with substantial savings and minimal liabilities

## Detailed Data Analysis

### 1. Identity Documentation
**ID Documents Provided**: Australian Driver's License (expiry 2032), Medicare Card (expiry 2027), Australian Passport (expiry 2030)

**Expiration Status**: All identification documents are current with no expiration concerns in the near future

**Name Consistency**: Name appears consistent as "Alexia Ligonnet" across all documentation

**Missing Documentation**: No missing identity documentation identified; all essential ID requirements are satisfied

### 2. Employment Verification
**Employment History**: 
- Healthcare Australia, EA/Office Manager (Full-Time, PAYG), October 26, 2024 - Current
- Acquire BPO, EA/Office Manager (Full-Time, PAYG), May 1, 2024 - July 7, 2024
- Accelagen, Clinical Trial Administrator (Full-Time, PAYG), February 1, 2021 - April 29, 2024

**Employment Gaps**: Gap period between July 7, 2024 and October 26, 2024 (approximately 3-month gap)

**Employer Verification Concerns**: 
- Current employment at Healthcare Australia is very recent (less than 1 month at time of application)
- Limited employment tenure with Acquire BPO (only 2 months)
- Contact information for Acquire BPO is limited (only mobile number, no contact name)

**Income Documentation**: Salary reported as $95,000 per year, but no specific mention of payslips or other income verification documentation

### 3. Residential History
**Residential Timeline**: Unit 9, 1279-1283 High Street, Malvern Victoria 3144 from March 2019 to Current

**Residential Gaps**: No residential history provided prior to March 2019, creating a significant gap in the standard 2-3 year history requirement

**Address Verification**: Current address appears valid but limited to only one address

**Stability Assessment**: Over 6 years at current address indicates residential stability, but lack of previous address history is concerning

### 4. Financial Information
**Account Documentation**: Multiple savings accounts documented with ING (accounts 9850, 7616, and 8943)

**Missing Financial Data**: No specific transaction history details provided to verify genuine savings over time

**Consistency Issues**: No inconsistencies identified in the financial information provided

### 5. Data Consistency Analysis
**Cross-Section Consistency**: Information appears consistent across different sections without contradictions

**Timeline Coherence**: Employment timeline shows reasonable progression except for the recent 3-month gap

**Entity Verification**: Healthcare Australia and Acquire BPO will require verification as recent employers; contact details are provided but may need additional validation

## Recommendations for Improvement

### Data Completion Recommendations
* Obtain and document residential history prior to March 2019 to establish a complete 2-3 year history
* Request additional employment verification documentation for current role at Healthcare Australia to address the recency concern
* Document explanation for the 3-month employment gap between Acquire BPO and Healthcare Australia positions

### Verification Enhancements
* Conduct comprehensive employment verification with Healthcare Australia to confirm stability and permanence of the new position
* Validate the recent employment history with reference checks from Accelagen given 3+ years of stability there

### Documentation Improvements
* Organize financial documentation to clearly show savings history and source of deposit funds
* Include more comprehensive employment documentation such as employment contracts and recent payslips

## Verification Action Plan

### Immediate Verification Priorities
* Verify current employment at Healthcare Australia including salary, position permanence and probation status
* Obtain previous residential address details prior to March 2019
* Confirm reason for 3-month employment gap between July and October 2024

### Secondary Verification Needs
* Verify superannuation details with Australian Super
* Confirm account balances with ING for all savings accounts
* Validate previous employment with Accelagen for the 3+ year period

### Suggested Verification Methods
* Request employment letter from Healthcare Australia confirming position, salary, and permanence
* Obtain utility bills or government correspondence for previous residential addresses
* Request explanation letter from applicant regarding the employment gap between positions
