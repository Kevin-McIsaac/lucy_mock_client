### Exit Strategy

#### Projected Position at Retirement

Both applicants plan to retire at age 65, which is in 26 years for John and 28 years for Emily.

Assumptions used:
- Property value growth rate: 3% p.a.
- Superannuation growth rate: 5% p.a.
- Loan amortization based on current P&I repayments
- No additional super contributions beyond employer mandatory

Projected figures at retirement:
- Property value: $2,644,000 (at 3% p.a. growth)
- Combined superannuation: $1,480,000 (at 5% p.a. growth)
- Loan balance: $0 (loan will be fully amortized before retirement)

#### Strategy

The clients have a robust exit strategy:

Primary strategy: Natural loan amortization
- The 30-year loan term will see the debt fully repaid before retirement
- Monthly P&I repayments ensure steady reduction in loan balance

Backup strategies:
1. Property downsizing
- Projected equity of $2,644,000 at retirement provides significant flexibility
- Downsizing could release substantial capital if needed

2. Superannuation
- Projected combined super balance of $1,480,000 provides additional security
- Could be accessed if required to clear any remaining debt at retirement

The exit strategy is considered low risk given:
- Long timeframe to retirement (26+ years)
- Strong asset position
- Multiple viable options for debt reduction
- Both borrowers maintain income protection insurance
