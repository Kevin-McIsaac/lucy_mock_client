### Exit Strategy

#### Projected Position at Retirement

Both applicants plan to retire at age 65, which is in 26 years for John and 28 years for Emily.

Assumptions used:
- Property growth rate: 3% p.a.
- Superannuation growth rate: 5% p.a.
- Investment growth rate: 4% p.a.

Projected position at retirement (2051):
- Property value: $2.6M (at 3% p.a. growth)
- Superannuation: $1.4M (John) + $1.3M (Emily) = $2.7M
- Investment portfolio: $240,000 (at 4% p.a. growth)
- Loan balance at retirement: $0 (loan term ends in 2055)

#### Strategy

The clients have indicated their primary exit strategy will be downsizing their home at retirement. Based on the projected property value of $2.6M, downsizing to a property worth $1.5M would release approximately $1.1M in equity. Combined with their projected superannuation balances totaling $2.7M and investment portfolio of $240,000, this provides multiple options for loan retirement:

1. Downsizing would provide sufficient funds to clear any remaining loan balance
2. Combined superannuation balances provide secondary backup option
3. Monthly repayments could be serviced through superannuation pension income if required

The exit strategy is considered robust given:
- Multiple options available
- Conservative growth assumptions used
- Strong asset position
- Both applicants retiring at standard retirement age
- Clear plan to downsize
