Your primary goal is to refinance your existing loan and access additional funds to renovate your home, specifically focusing on your kitchen, outdoor area, and adding an extra bedroom. You are looking to leverage existing equity and your personal savings for this. You also expressed a clear preference for competitive interest rates, minimal fees, strong customer service, and a smooth approval process by June 2025 to align with your renovation schedule. Our research and recommendations are designed to align precisely with what you are looking to achieve, ensuring we find a solution that supports your renovation plans and enhances your financial position.

**Rationale for Recommendation**
We believe this refinance solution with Bank Australia is in your best interest and aligns perfectly with your renovation and financial goals.

Firstly, it provides a competitive interest rate compared to your existing Commonwealth Bank loan at 5.20%. By taking advantage of a 5.13% variable rate and a 4.84% fixed rate, you benefit from immediate savings on interest costs. The split loan structure is designed to meet your preference for balancing potential interest rate reductions with the stability of predictable repayments, making budgeting easier for you.

Secondly, the recommended loan amount of $923,672.00 directly facilitates your renovation plans, allowing you to access the necessary funds for your kitchen, outdoor area, and extra bedroom. The variable split also includes an offset account feature, which was a key preference for you, providing easy access to your funds while helping reduce the interest charged on that portion of your loan over time.

Bank Australia was specifically chosen over other alternatives we considered, such as Westpac, ING, and Macquarie, because it not only offers a lower ongoing interest rate and lower fees but also aligns with your preference for a lender with strong customer service and ethical banking practices. This combination ensures you get a financially beneficial solution that also resonates with your personal values and prior experience with your current bank.

Finally, the smooth approval process with Bank Australia is crucial for your renovation timeline, aiming for a settlement by August 1, 2025, which aligns with your goal of starting renovations. This recommendation supports your immediate renovation needs and enhances your financial position for the future.

**Fees and charges**
For the recommended Bank Australia solution, you will be liable for an upfront application fee of $350, which applies to the variable portion of the loan. There are no ongoing monthly or annual fees charged directly by the lender for either split of your loan.

When compared to other products we considered, many included additional ongoing monthly or annual fees, or higher upfront and discharge fees. For example, some variable options had ongoing monthly fees of $10 or annual fees of $248 or $395, in addition to upfront and discharge costs. By choosing Bank Australia, you are avoiding these recurring ongoing fees, which further supports our recommendation as being in your best interest by minimising your overall costs throughout the life of the loan. This aligns with your preference for minimal fees.
