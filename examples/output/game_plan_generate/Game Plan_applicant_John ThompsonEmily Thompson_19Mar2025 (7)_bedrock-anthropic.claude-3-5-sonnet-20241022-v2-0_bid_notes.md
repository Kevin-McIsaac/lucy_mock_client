**Approach**  
After assessing over 30 lenders in the market, we narrowed down to 5 lenders who could best support your refinancing and renovation goals. Your priority was finding a competitive rate while accessing the renovation funds needed, with a preference for lenders offering strong customer service including Bank Australia, Bank of Sydney and ING. The research and recommendations focused on finding a solution that provides both competitive pricing and the flexibility needed to complete your planned $150,000 renovation project.

**Recommendation**  
We recommend refinancing your existing $800,000 CBA loan to Bank Australia with a split loan structure totaling $923,672:
- Split 1: $423,672 variable rate at 5.13% p.a. ($2,308.14 monthly repayments)
- Split 2: $500,000 fixed for 3 years at 4.84% p.a. ($2,635.43 monthly repayments)
- Total monthly repayments: $4,943.57

This structure provides $150,000 in renovation funds while also consolidating your $22,000 car loan.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This solution strongly aligns with your goals by:
- Providing the $150,000 renovation funding needed for your kitchen, outdoor area and extra bedroom
- Reducing your current 5.20% CBA rate to more competitive rates (5.13% variable and 4.84% fixed)
- Offering a split structure that balances rate security with flexibility
- Including an offset account on the variable portion to help manage renovation funds
- Meeting your preference for an ethical lender with strong customer service
- Aligning with your August 2025 timeline for starting renovations

**Compared Products**  
We compared solutions from ING, Westpac and other major lenders. While some offered similar rates, Bank Australia was selected because:
- More competitive fixed rate at 4.84% vs next best at 5.59% (ING)
- Lower fees with just a $350 annual package fee
- Simpler loan structure and better customer service alignment
- Strong sustainability focus through their Clean Energy Home Loan product

While ING offered a marginally lower variable rate on their Mortgage Simplifier product (5.89% vs 5.93%), the overall Bank Australia solution provides better value through the significantly lower fixed rate portion and reduced fees.

**Fees and charges**  
The Bank Australia solution has minimal fees:
- $350 annual package fee
- No application fees
- No monthly account keeping fees
- No establishment fees

This compares favorably to other lenders like ING ($248 monthly fee) and Westpac ($395 annual fee + $200 establishment fee). The low fee structure combined with the competitive interest rates ensures this recommendation delivers the best overall value while meeting your needs.
