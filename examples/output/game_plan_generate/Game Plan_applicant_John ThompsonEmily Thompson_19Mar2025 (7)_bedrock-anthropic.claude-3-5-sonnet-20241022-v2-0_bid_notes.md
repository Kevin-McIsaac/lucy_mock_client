**Approach**  
I have assessed over 30 lenders in the market and narrowed this down to 5 lenders who are the most suitable options considering your needs and financial position. Your goal is to refinance your existing $800,000 CBA loan and access $150,000 for home renovations, while getting a more competitive rate and better service. Your preferences include ethical lenders like Bank Australia, ING and Bank of Sydney, with a focus on competitive rates, minimal fees and strong customer service. The research and recommendations are designed to help you achieve this while ensuring alignment with your August 2025 renovation timeline.

**Recommendation**  
After careful analysis, I recommend proceeding with Bank Australia with a split loan structure totaling $923,672:
- Split 1: $423,672 variable rate at 5.13% p.a. with monthly repayments of $2,308.14
- Split 2: $500,000 3-year fixed rate at 4.84% p.a. with monthly repayments of $2,635.43
Total initial monthly repayments will be $4,943.57.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This solution aligns with your goals and preferences by:
- Providing ethical banking through Bank Australia, matching your lender preferences
- Offering competitive rates lower than your current 5.20% CBA rate
- Structuring the loan with both fixed and variable portions to provide rate stability while maintaining flexibility
- Including an offset account on the variable portion for easy access to renovation funds while reducing interest
- Minimal fees with only a $350 annual fee
- Meeting your timeline for August 2025 settlement and renovations
- Allowing you to refinance away from CBA where you've had poor service experiences

**Compared Products**  
We compared solutions from ING, Bank of Sydney, Westpac and Macquarie. While some offered similar rates, Bank Australia provided the best overall package:
- ING's variable rate of 5.89% and fixed rate of 5.59% were both higher
- Bank of Sydney had a higher variable rate of 5.94% plus a $248 monthly fee
- Westpac required a $395 annual fee with higher rates
- Macquarie's rates were higher at 6.05% variable

While some lenders had slightly lower application fees, the ongoing interest savings and ethical banking focus of Bank Australia made it the superior choice aligned with your preferences and goals.

**Fees and charges**  
Bank Australia has very competitive fee structure:
- $350 annual fee
- No monthly fees
- No application fees
- No establishment fees
- No valuation fees
- No legal fees charged by the lender

Compared to other lenders who charge monthly package fees ($248-395) or higher annual fees, Bank Australia provides excellent value. The minimal fee structure combined with the competitive interest rates ensures this recommendation provides the best value aligned with your needs.
