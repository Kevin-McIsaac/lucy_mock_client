### **Exit Strategy Overview**

Dear John and Emily Thompson,

You're looking to borrow $923,672 over a 30-year term to refinance your existing loan and fund home renovations. At your current ages of 39 (John) and 37 (Emily), this loan will extend into your retirement years. An exit strategy is crucial as it outlines how you'll manage your loan obligations, particularly as you approach your planned retirement age of 65.

### **Overall Strategy**

Your stated intention to downsize in retirement provides a solid foundation for your exit strategy. Based on your current financial position, including combined income of $255,000 per year, growing superannuation balances ($340,000 combined), and a property valued at $1,200,000, you're well-positioned to manage this loan effectively. The split loan structure ($423,672 variable and $500,000 fixed) gives you flexibility while maintaining payment stability.

### **Projected Position at Retirement**

Assuming conservative growth rates, at your retirement age of 65 (in approximately 26 years):

* Remaining loan balance: ~$385,000 (based on minimum repayments)
* Property value: ~$2,600,000 (at 3% annual growth)
* Combined superannuation: ~$1,400,000 (at 5% annual growth)
* Net equity position: ~$2,215,000
* Potential retirement income: ~$70,000-$80,000 per year (combined pension + super)

### **Exit Strategy Options**

1. Downsizing: Selling your property at retirement could release approximately $2.2M in equity (after loan repayment). This would allow you to purchase a smaller property for $1-1.2M, leaving significant funds for retirement.

2. Gradual Loan Reduction: By making additional repayments of $500 per month (feasible given your current income), you could reduce the loan balance by an additional $156,000 before retirement, leaving a more manageable debt level of ~$229,000.

3. Superannuation Lump Sum: Using $385,000 from your projected $1.4M super balance to clear the remaining debt would still leave substantial retirement funds while eliminating mortgage payments.

### **Strategies to Improve Position**

You can strengthen your position by utilizing your offset account against the variable portion ($423,672) to reduce interest charges while maintaining access to funds. Consider salary sacrificing additional super contributions to take advantage of tax benefits and compound growth. With your combined income of $255,000, you have capacity to make extra mortgage repayments while building your investment portfolio through additional ETF investments similar to your existing $75,000 holding.

### **Risk Factors and Contingencies**

Key risks include property market downturns, interest rate increases, and health issues affecting income. Mitigate these through maintaining adequate income protection insurance (which you currently have), building an emergency fund beyond your current $30,000 savings, and regularly reviewing your split loan structure to ensure it remains optimal for your circumstances.

### **Next Steps**

Schedule a review of this strategy with me every 12 months to track progress and adjust as needed. Consider meeting with a financial planner to align your super and investment strategy with this exit plan. Keep monitoring your offset account usage and look for opportunities to make additional repayments when possible. I'll help you assess refinancing options regularly to ensure you maintain competitive rates.
