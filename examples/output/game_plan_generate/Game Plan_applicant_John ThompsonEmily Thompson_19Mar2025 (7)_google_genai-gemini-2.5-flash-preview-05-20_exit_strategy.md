### **Exit Strategy Overview**

Hi John and Emily,

This document outlines an "Exit Strategy" for your new home loan of $923,672 over a 30-year term. Currently, John is 39 years old and Emily is 37 years old. An exit strategy is a crucial roadmap that helps you understand how you plan to manage and ultimately repay your loan over the long term, especially as you approach significant life milestones like retirement. It provides a clear picture of your financial position in the future, helping you make informed decisions to ensure your long-term financial security and achieve your goals.

### **Overall Strategy**

Your primary strategy for managing your loan into retirement, as discussed, is to downsize your home. This involves selling your current property and purchasing a smaller, less expensive property, using the released equity to significantly reduce or fully repay your outstanding loan balance.

Given your loan term is 30 years and John plans to retire at age 65 (26 years from now), and Emily at 65 (28 years from now), your loan is projected to extend beyond your planned retirement ages. Downsizing will be a key mechanism to manage this overlap, providing a lump sum to clear the remaining debt and free up cash flow during your retirement years. This approach aligns with your goal of simplifying your financial commitments as you transition out of full-time employment.

### **Projected Position at Retirement**

Let's look at your projected financial position when John reaches his planned retirement age of 65, approximately 26 years from now. These projections are based on conservative assumptions to give you a realistic outlook.

*   **Projected Remaining Loan Balance at Retirement:** Based on your current loan amount of $923,672 over 30 years, and assuming minimum required principal and interest repayments at the ongoing variable interest rate of 5.93% per annum, we project your remaining loan balance to be approximately **$187,000** when John turns 65.
*   **Projected Property Value at Retirement:** Your current home is valued at $1,200,000. Assuming a conservative annual property growth rate of 3% per annum, your home could be worth approximately **$2,587,320** at John's retirement.
*   **Projected Superannuation Balance at Retirement:**
    *   Currently, John has $180,000 and Emily has $160,000 in superannuation, totalling $340,000.
    *   Assuming a conservative superannuation growth rate of 5% per annum, and continued employer contributions (Superannuation Guarantee) based on your current combined income of $255,000 per annum, your combined superannuation balance could grow to approximately **$2,616,218** when John retires.
*   **Projected Equity Position at Retirement:** Based on these projections, your equity in the property at John's retirement could be approximately **$2,400,320** ($2,587,320 projected property value minus $187,000 projected remaining loan balance).
*   **Potential Retirement Income Sources:**
    *   **Downsizing Proceeds:** By selling your home with substantial equity, you could release a significant lump sum. For example, if you sell for $2,587,320 and repay the $187,000 loan, you would have over $2.4 million in equity. If you then purchase a smaller home for, say, $1,000,000, you would have approximately $1,400,000 in cash available to invest or supplement your retirement.
    *   **Superannuation Income Stream:** Your projected combined superannuation balance of over $2.6 million could provide a substantial income stream. A conservative drawdown of 5% per annum would provide approximately $130,810 per year, well above the comfortable retirement standard for a couple. This income would be tax-free from age 60.
    *   **Investment Income:** Your current share portfolio, projected to grow to approximately $254,000, could also provide additional income or be liquidated as needed.

### **Exit Strategy Options**

Based on your projected financial position, here are three potential exit strategy options:

*   **1. Selling and Downsizing:** This is your stated preference and a highly effective strategy. By selling your current home (projected value $2,587,320) and repaying the estimated $187,000 loan balance, you would free up approximately $2,400,320 in equity. If you then purchase a smaller, debt-free home for, say, $1,000,000, you would have approximately $1,400,320 in liquid funds. This lump sum could be invested to generate additional income, used for travel, or simply provide a significant financial buffer, ensuring a comfortable, debt-free retirement.

*   **2. Using Superannuation Lump Sum to Reduce Debt:** If you prefer to stay in your current home, you could use a portion of your superannuation to pay off the remaining loan balance at retirement. With a projected combined super balance of over $2.6 million, taking out $187,000 to clear the debt would still leave you with a substantial superannuation balance of approximately $2,429,218. This would eliminate your mortgage
