**Approach**  
We have assessed over 50 lenders in the market and narrowed this down to 5 lenders who are the most suitable options considering your needs and financial position. Your primary goal is to refinance your existing Commonwealth Bank loan of $800,000 and access additional funds to renovate your home, with a focus on completing kitchen and outdoor area renovations and adding an extra bedroom. You prefer lenders offering competitive rates, minimal fees, strong customer service, and ethical banking practices, with a preference for ING, Bank Australia, and Bank of Sydney. We have prioritised lenders that can ensure a smooth approval process by June 2025 to align with your renovation schedule. Our research and recommendations are tailored to support these goals while offering flexibility and stability in your loan structure.

**Recommendation**  
We recommend refinancing with Bank Australia, structuring your total loan amount of $923,672 in two splits over 30 years:  
- Split 1: $423,672 on a variable rate of 5.13% p.a., with initial monthly repayments of $2,308.14. This split includes an offset account for interest savings and easy access to funds.  
- Split 2: $500,000 on a 3-year fixed rate at 4.84% p.a., with initial monthly repayments of $2,635.43, providing repayment stability and budgeting certainty during the fixed term.  

Your total initial monthly repayments across both splits will be approximately $4,943.57. This split loan structure balances the opportunity for potential rate decreases on the variable portion with the predictability of fixed repayments, perfectly supporting your renovation funding and financial objectives.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This solution aligns with your preferences and objectives by providing:  
- Competitive interest rates below your current Commonwealth Bank rate of 5.20%, reducing your repayment burden.  
- A flexible split loan structure giving you both security and the ability to benefit from potential future interest rate falls.  
- Offset account facility on the variable portion to reduce interest costs and offer easy access to funds, which is important during your renovation process.  
- Ethical banking and superior customer service, meeting your preference for a lender like Bank Australia, which outperformed other preferred lenders in ongoing rates, fees, and service quality.  
- A smooth and timely approval process to ensure funding is available by August 2025, aligning exactly with your renovation start date.  

This recommendation supports your goal of enhancing your home’s value and functionality without compromising financial stability.

**Compared Products**  
We compared Bank Australia’s offer to products from Westpac, ING, Macquarie, and others. While some alternatives, such as ING or Westpac, offered competitive fixed or variable rates, Bank Australia provided:  
- Lower ongoing interest rates overall, which translates into significant savings over the loan life.  
- Fewer fees and no upfront application fees compared to some alternatives charging higher establishment or ongoing fees.  
- A better combination of features including the offset account facility on the variable split, which was unavailable or limited on lower-rate products.  
- Ethical banking practices and strong customer service, consistent with your lender preferences and values, which were not matched by all competitors.  
Products with slightly lower headline rates lacked the flexible split structure or the offset account feature crucial to your needs, or came with higher fees making them less cost-effective in your case.

**Fees and charges**  
No application or upfront fees are payable directly to the lender in this recommendation, aside from a $350 ongoing fee applicable on the variable portion. There are no standard legal or valuation fees proposed beyond usual settlement costs. Compared to other options which included some upfront establishment fees or higher ongoing fees (up to $395 per month in some alternatives), this solution keeps costs low and transparent. The lender’s fee structure, combined with the offset account benefits and competitive rates, ensures this recommendation is in your best interest by minimising total loan costs and supporting your renovation funding efficiently.
