### Purpose

Hannah and Justin are refinancing their owner-occupied home at 19 Harness Court, Sydenham, VIC to secure a lower interest rate and improve their cash flow. Their aim is to minimise interest over the loan’s life, maximising equity growth ahead of their long-term financial and retirement objectives. The refinance to ANZ will allow them to reduce annual interest costs by approximately $2,700 and receive a $2,000 cashback, with no LMI applicable due to a sub-80% LVR. They have selected a variable rate with offset and redraw features to maintain repayment flexibility and support their strategy of building savings and reducing loan interest over time.

### Living Expenses

We have discussed with the clients their monthly living expenses after reviewing their budget and banking transaction history.

### Background

Hannah and Justin are in a strong financial position to refinance. They are both Australian citizens, married, with no dependants. Both are in stable, ongoing full-time employment in established roles and industries. Their current borrowing represents a 78.47% LVR on a conservatively valued security of $720,000. The outgoing loan is being cleared as part of this transaction; there are no arrears or adverse credit history, and both clients have well-conducted accounts and a disciplined savings record (notably, $25,316.48 in savings and additional smaller cash amounts). They have selected a lender and product that offers tangible, immediate cost savings and future repayment flexibility, supporting their goals to build equity, reduce financial stress, and set up for retirement.  
We have asked the clients the following questions & they have replied ‘no’ to both:

* At this point in time, are you aware of any changes to your broader situation that may impact on your earning capacity?  
* Have you been advised of any changes to your employment circumstances or income levels that will affect your ability to meet any existing debts or expenses?

### Conditions

Existing home loan at Great Southern Bank ($553,292.85) to be fully repaid from refinance proceeds. No other debts are being refinanced or consolidated into the new loan at this time. Justin's student loan ($15,794) will remain in place and serviced as per current arrangements. Credit card account (limit $28,800, balance $0) maintained with no intention to close.

### Exit Strategy

#### Projected Position at Retirement

**Client ages at loan drawdown:**  
- Hannah: 30  
- Justin: 31  
Both clients plan to retire at age 65, resulting in a projected working period of 35 years (though loan term is 30 years).

**Projected remaining loan balance at retirement:**  
Assuming scheduled principal & interest payments with no extra repayments, loan will be fully repaid in 30 years, i.e. at Hannah’s age 60, Justin’s age 61, approximately 5 years before stated desired retirement. Projected balance at retirement: $0.

**Projected property value at retirement:**  
Base value $720,000. Assuming conservative annual growth of 3% over 35 years:  
Future Value = $720,000 × (1.03^35) ≈ $2,034,000

**Projected superannuation balances at retirement:**  
Current balances:  
- Hannah: $75,370  
- Justin: $43,653.50  
Assume annual salary super contributions at SG rate (11%) on current salaries (no employer/market increases factored).  
Assume conservative average growth of 5% p.a., compounded for 35 years, no additional voluntary contributions:

- Hannah: Future Value ≈ $75,370 × (1.05^35) ≈ $423,000 (existing balance only).  
- Justin: Future Value ≈ $43,653.50 × (1.05^35) ≈ $245,000 (existing balance only).

**Note:** Future contributions (11% SG on their incomes) will significantly boost these figures:
- Hannah: $153,295 × 11% = $16,862 p.a. SG; FV of 35-year annuity at 5% growth = approx. $1,710,000.
- Justin: $90,154 × 11% = $9,917 p.a. SG; FV of 35-year annuity at 5% = approx. $1,006,000.

Estimated retirement super balances:  
- Hannah: ~$2,133,000  
- Justin: ~$1,251,000  
- **Total estimated super at retirement:** ~$3,384,000

**Projected total equity position at retirement:**  
- Property: ~$2,034,000  
- Superannuation: ~$3,384,000  
- Personal savings/assets: assumed to be modest, not material for primary exit

**Potential retirement income sources and amounts:**  
- Drawdown from superannuation (allocating pension), plus any Age Pension eligibility (not factored).
- If desired, rental or downsizing options from primary residence.

**Assumptions:**
- 3% p.a. property value growth, 5% p.a. super growth, 11% SG contributions, no break in employment, standard loan amortisation, no substantial early repayments, no major unplanned financial hardship.

#### Strategy

Client’s ages and retirement plans have been considered and an exit strategy has been discussed. Both intend to retire at age 65, and the 30-year loan term will see the debt fully repaid before their intended retirement age (at approximately Hannah age 60, Justin 61), assuming standard repayments. At point of retirement, the property will be owned outright (projected value ~$2,034,000). Their superannuation balances are projected to be in excess of $3,300,000 combined, representing a strong asset base capable of comfortably generating retirement income and providing further flexibility should their circumstances change.

If unforeseen circumstances arise (such as prolonged income reduction), clients may elect to:  
- Utilise savings or superannuation to reduce debt and/or  
- Downsize, releasing substantial property equity (over $2 million projected at retirement)  
- Service loan with retirement income in the unlikely event of debt remaining (not required based on projections).

In summary, the clients are prudent, have a demonstrated history of responsible financial behaviour, and are committed to clearing their loan well prior to retirement. Their projected equity and superannuation provide ample means for a lender-acceptable exit strategy and the capacity to absorb changes in their financial circumstance.
