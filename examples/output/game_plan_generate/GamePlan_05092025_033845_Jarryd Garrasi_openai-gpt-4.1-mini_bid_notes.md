**Approach**  
We have assessed over 30 lenders in the market and narrowed this down to 3 lenders who are the most suitable options considering your needs and financial position. Your primary goal is to purchase your first home with a total loan amount of $435,000 under the First Home Guarantee Scheme, aiming for a purchase price up to $510,000. You prefer a 30-year loan term with principal and interest repayments to fit within your retirement strategy and minimize monthly repayments. You also prefer a split loan structure with approximately half fixed for 3 years to provide certainty, and half variable to allow flexibility and to potentially benefit from future rate decreases. Your preference includes features such as an offset account for interest savings and redraw facility for access to prepaid funds. Our research and recommendations have been designed to align closely with these goals, preferences, and financial circumstances ensuring your best interests are prioritised.

**Recommendation**  
We recommend proceeding with a split home loan with National Australia Bank (NAB) as the lender, taking advantage of the First Home Guarantee Scheme to save over $5,000 in Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) costs. The proposed loan splits are as follows:  
- Split 1: $220,000 at a variable rate of 5.99% p.a., principal and interest repayments of approximately $591.62 per fortnight.  
- Split 2: $215,000 fixed for 3 years at 5.39% p.a., principal and interest repayments of approximately $556.59 per fortnight.  
Combined, your initial total fortnightly repayments will be around $1,126.13. The loan term is 30 years with features including an $8 per month offset account fee and redraw facility, supporting your goal to reduce interest payable and keep repayment flexibility. Settlement is targeted around 1 July 2025.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This solution fits your objectives well: The fixed portion offers repayment certainty and budgeting peace of mind for the initial 3 years, protecting you from potential interest rate rises. The variable portion provides repayment flexibility to make additional payments without penalty, essential to your goal of reducing debt faster and aligning repayments with your future financial plans, including retirement at age 67. NAB’s offering under the First Home Guarantee Scheme aligns perfectly to help you buy your desired home up to $510,000 without incurring costly LMI fees. The lower offset account fee with NAB compared to competitors reduces ongoing costs and supports your preference for an offset account to save interest. The split loan structure meets your desire for balance between stability and flexibility in repayments, enhancing your cash flow management and long-term debt reduction strategy.

**Compared Products**  
We compared the recommended NAB splits to alternatives such as other variable offset loans and fixed rate loans with competing lenders. For Split 1, other variable offset products had slightly higher rates (5.93% and 6.04%) and significantly higher total lifetime costs, by over $30,000 and $34,000 respectively, mostly due to higher rates or fees. For Split 2, some fixed-rate loans offered slightly lower fixed rates (e.g., 5.44% vs 5.39% NAB) with marginally lower overall lifetime costs; however, these lenders did not offer spots under the First Home Guarantee Scheme which would have resulted in additional LMI costs exceeding $5,000—costs that exceed any small interest rate savings. Furthermore, the NAB loan’s offset account fee is far lower ($8 per month) compared to $395 per annum from competitors, providing ongoing savings and better alignment with your preferences. Fixed rate loans with other lenders also lacked the flexibility in redraw and offset features and carried risks of break costs. Overall, NAB’s comprehensive product features combined with cost benefits and scheme eligibility best align with your long-term objectives.

**Fees and charges**  
The NAB loan includes an $8 per month fee for the offset account, which is significantly less costly than annual package fees ($395 p.a.) charged by other lenders. There are no upfront application fees or ongoing monthly fees besides the offset account fee. No legal, valuation, or establishment fees are payable directly to the lender. While NAB does not charge for redraw or discharge fees, it is important to understand that break costs may apply if fixed portions are repaid or switched early during fixed terms. The low ongoing fees combined with the potential $5,000+ savings on LMI demonstrate that this loan structure is financially advantageous and supports your best interest by reducing total loan costs while delivering important product features you value.
