### Purpose

John and Emily are refinancing their existing home loan to fund significant renovations to their family home at 14 Willow Crescent, Fernbank Creek NSW. The refinance allows them to access $150,000 in equity, plus $50,000 in personal savings, to upgrade the kitchen, create an additional bedroom, and enhance the outdoor living space. The applicants are seeking a competitive rate, offset facilities, and minimal fees, in line with their expressed desire for ethical banking and responsive customer service. By consolidating borrowing and repaying a car loan during the process, they not only improve their family’s immediate living conditions but also increase their property’s future value and functionality.

### Income

John is employed full time as an IT Systems Engineer with Telstra Corporation Ltd, a position he has held since 01-Jan-2018. His base salary is $120,000 p.a. John’s employment is stable, he is not on probation and has industry tenure of over 7 years.

Emily has full time employment as a Senior Financial Analyst with Westpac Banking Corporation, commencing in her current role in March 2016. She receives a salary of $135,000 p.a. With 9+ years of steady employment within the banking sector and demonstrated career progression, Emily’s income position is stable.

**Additional Income**:  
There are no other disclosed supplementary incomes, government benefits, or deductions such as negative gearing or salary sacrifice.

### Living Expenses

We have discussed with the clients their monthly living expenses after reviewing their budget and banking transaction history.

### Background

John and Emily are a married couple with two dependants (ages 10 and 6), residing at 14 Willow Crescent, Fernbank Creek. They are established professionals with a solid employment history and consistent income. Both are committed to prudent financial management as demonstrated by:

* No records of arrears, bankruptcy or credit impairments  
* A manageable existing liability profile, with only one residual credit card and a small HELP debt after refinance  
* Strong insurance coverage (life, income protection, home and contents) in place for both personal and property security  
* A demonstrated pattern of savings and investment activity in the form of a $75,000 ETF portfolio and $30,000 in savings

**Character**: Excellent account conduct and long-term professional employment evidence strong reliability.  
**Capacity**: Borrowers’ combined gross annual income of $255,000, with a considered approach to living expenses ($6,850/month) confirms demonstrated repayment ability.  
**Capital**: Overall net asset position is robust, with a $1,200,000 home, $75,000 in listed securities, $30,000 cash at bank, and two superannuation balances totalling $340,000 (John $180,000, Emily $160,000).  
**Collateral**: High quality, owner-occupied property at a conservative LVR of 76.97%.  
**Conditions**: The refinance not only secures funds for home improvement but also consolidates existing liabilities and streamlines their debt structure for greater repayment certainty.

We have asked the clients the following questions & they have replied ‘no’ to both:

* At this point in time, are you aware of any changes to your broader situation that may impact on your earning capacity?  
* Have you been advised of any changes to your employment circumstances or income levels that will affect your ability to meet any existing debts or expenses?

### Conditions

Liabilities to be cleared at settlement include:

* Refinancing and closing out the current CBA loan ($800,000 limit, $650,000 balance)
* Discharging the Macquarie motor vehicle loan ($22,000)
* All other debts (ANZ credit card, $9,000; HELP debt, $15,000) retained post-settlement

The car loan will be paid out and closed as part of the transaction. No other new significant debts are contemplated.

### Exit Strategy

#### Projected Position at Retirement

Both John and Emily confirm retirement plans at age 65 (John: DOB 12-Jun-1985, Emily: DOB 25-Sep-1987). Loan maturity will occur after their intended retirement (approximate loan term remaining at age 65: 20 years for each).

**Assumptions:**  
* Property value annual growth: 3% p.a. (conservative)  
* Superannuation growth: 5% p.a. (conservative, contributions grossed up by SGC until age 65)  
* No significant changes to household structure or income  
* Loan repayments continue per schedule, minimum required (principal & interest)  
* Offset account not used to accelerate repayments

**Projections at age 65 (2050 John; 2052 Emily):**

* **Projected property value (at age 65):**  
  $1,200,000 × (1.03)^25 ≈ $2,511,000  
* **Estimated home loan balance (assuming scheduled minimum P&I repayments):**  
  After 25 years, estimated remaining loan = approximately $200,000 (Split amortised on P&I, based on typical schedules for $923,672 starting principal over 30 years. This is a conservative estimate.)
* **Projected superannuation balance:**  
  - John: $180,000 × (1.05)^25 ≈ $610,000 (not including ongoing contributions; actual will likely be higher)  
  - Emily: $160,000 × (1.05)^27 ≈ $590,000 (not including ongoing contributions; actual will likely be higher)  
  - **Combined: $1,200,000+**
* **Other assets:**  
  - ETF portfolio: $75,000 × (1.04)^25 ≈ $200,000 (reinvested, not drawn down)
  - Contents, vehicle, and cash excluded from retirement projections for conservatism
* **Total projected equity at retirement:**  
  Property net of mortgage: $2,511,000 – $200,000 = $2,311,000  
  Superannuation: ≈ $1,200,000  
  ETF: ≈ $200,000  
  **Total: approx. $3,711,000**

* **Potential retirement income sources:**  
  - Superannuation drawdowns (allocated pensions)
  - Continued ETF dividends (~$8,000 p.a. at 4% yield)
  - Social security entitlements after age eligibility

#### Strategy

John and Emily have explicitly outlined that their primary exit strategy at retirement is **downsizing their principal residence**. On reaching age 65, they anticipate selling 14 Willow Crescent, releasing an estimated $2,311,000 in net equity (after repaying the projected remaining loan balance).

This strategy is more than adequate to clear any remaining home loan debt (conservatively projected at $200,000), with substantial surplus equity to purchase a smaller home outright, supplement retirement savings, or maintain additional liquidity. Should they prefer to remain in their home post-retirement, alternative options such as using a portion of their superannuation lump sum or drawing an income stream to continue servicing a residual home loan balance are also feasible, given projected retirement savings exceeding $1,200,000.

**In summary**:  
The borrowers’ exit strategies are robust and well documented. Either (1) sale and downsizing or (2) drawing down superannuation are viable pathways, with both options providing comfortable buffers to eliminate debt and provide for a high standard of living in retirement, even under conservative growth and repayment assumptions.
