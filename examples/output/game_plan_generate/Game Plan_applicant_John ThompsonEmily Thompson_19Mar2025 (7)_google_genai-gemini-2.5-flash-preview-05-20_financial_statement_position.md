## **Your Financial Goals**

### **Short-Term Goals (0-2 years)**

*   Renovate your home, specifically the kitchen, outdoor area, and by adding an extra bedroom.
*   Complete renovations by August 2025, aligning with your settlement schedule.
*   Ensure a smooth loan approval process by June 2025.
*   Repay the existing Macquarie Car Loan.

### **Medium to Long-Term Goals (3+ years)**

*   Increase your homeâ€™s overall value and functionality through renovations.
*   Plan for retirement at age 65 (for both John and Emily).
*   Propose to repay the loan by downsizing your home at retirement.

## **Strengthening Your Financial Position**

### **Cash Flow Management**

John and Emily, with a significant monthly surplus of over $132,000.00, your focus can shift from managing tight budgets to strategically allocating your funds. Consider automating transfers of your surplus into your offset account, dedicated investment accounts, or superannuation to accelerate wealth accumulation. We can work together to establish clear financial targets for this surplus, ensuring it aligns with your short and long-term goals. Reviewing your current discretionary spending, though comfortable, can help identify areas where even more funds can be directed towards your financial objectives.

### **Debt Management**

Your new split loan structure provides both stability and flexibility. With your substantial income, you have a strong capacity to accelerate debt reduction. Prioritize the rapid repayment of your ANZ Credit Card and Student Loan, as these typically carry higher interest rates and do not benefit from the offset account. Maximise the use of your offset account linked to the variable portion of your home loan to significantly reduce interest paid over the loan term. We can explore options for additional principal repayments on the variable portion once your renovation funds are fully utilised, potentially reducing your loan term dramatically.

### **Wealth Building Opportunities**

Your robust financial position presents exceptional opportunities for wealth creation. Beyond the value added by your home renovations, consider strategically building your investment portfolio. This could involve increasing contributions to your existing ETF portfolio or exploring further investment avenues such as additional property acquisitions. Given your stated retirement plans, we should also review your superannuation strategy to ensure you are maximising contributions and investment options to build a substantial retirement nest egg. We can discuss diversifying your investments to align with your risk appetite and long-term objectives.

## **Your Financial Protection**

John and Emily, you currently have existing life and income protection insurance policies, which is excellent for ensuring financial security for your family. You also maintain a comprehensive home and contents insurance policy. While this provides a solid foundation, we should review the adequacy of these covers, especially given your increased debt, the significant value of your renovated home, and your substantial income. We can also discuss other potential protection areas, such as critical illness or Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) cover, to ensure all aspects of your financial wellbeing are safeguarded.

## **Our Ongoing Partnership**

### **Regular Review Schedule**

We recommend reviewing your financial position and loan structure:

*   Initial follow-up: 3 months after settlement
*   First comprehensive review: 24 months after settlement
*   Regular reviews: Every 24 months thereafter
*   Fixed rate expiry review: May 2028
