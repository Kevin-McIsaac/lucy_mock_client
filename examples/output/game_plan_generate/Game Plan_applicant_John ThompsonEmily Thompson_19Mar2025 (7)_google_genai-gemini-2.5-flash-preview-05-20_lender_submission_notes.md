### Purpose

John and Emily Thompson are seeking to refinance their existing Commonwealth Bank loan of $800,000 and obtain additional funds for significant home renovations. Their immediate goals are to complete kitchen and outdoor area renovations and add an extra bedroom to their property. This will increase their home's value and functionality. They are leveraging $150,000 in existing equity and contributing $50,000 in personal savings towards the estimated $150,000 renovation costs. They are looking for a lender offering competitive rates, minimal fees, strong customer service, and align with their preference for ethical banking practices. Ensuring a smooth approval process by June 2025 is crucial to align with their renovation schedule.

### Income

John Thompson is employed full-time as an IT Systems Engineer at Telstra Corporation Ltd and has been with his current employer since January 2018. His annual base income is $120,000.

Emily Thompson is employed full-time as a Senior Financial Analyst at Westpac Banking Corporation and has been with her current employer since March 2016. Her annual base income is $135,000.

### Living Expenses

We have discussed with the clients their monthly living expenses after reviewing their budget and banking transaction history.

### Background

John and Emily Thompson are a strong loan candidate, demonstrating excellent financial character and capacity. They have stable, long-term employment with reputable companies (John since Jan 2018, Emily since Mar 2016), indicating consistent income and reliability. Their financial conduct is strong, with no reported arrears on any debts.

Their capacity to service the loan is robust. With a combined annual income of $255,000 and current monthly living expenses of $6,850, the proposed monthly repayments of $4,943.57 are well within their means. Furthermore, they are actively improving their financial position by consolidating and repaying their $22,000 car loan as part of this refinance, which will free up additional monthly cash flow.

In terms of capital, the clients possess significant assets. They have substantial equity in their owner-occupied property, valued at $1,200,000, and are contributing $50,000 in genuine savings towards the renovation costs. Their total assets, including motor vehicles, shares, savings, and superannuation, amount to $540,000.

The collateral for this loan is their owner-occupied property at 14 Willow Crescent, Fernbank Creek, NSW 2444. The current Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) is a healthy 76.97%. The planned renovations (kitchen, outdoor area, additional bedroom) are expected to further enhance the property's value and functionality, strengthening the security for the loan.

The conditions surrounding this application are clear: the purpose is to refinance their existing mortgage and fund value-adding renovations, with a preference for a lender offering competitive rates
