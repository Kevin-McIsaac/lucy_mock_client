### Purpose

Alexia is seeking approval to purchase her first home in Victoria, with a purchase price of $510,000 under the First Home Guarantee Scheme. The total loan amount sought is $435,000, with funds to complete the purchase coming primarily from her genuine savings. The chosen structure combines a variable and fixed split, supporting budget certainty and repayment flexibility. Alexia is utilising NAB's participation in the First Home Guarantee Scheme to avoid LMI, maximising her purchase power and minimising up-front costs.

### Income

Alexia is employed full-time as an Executive Assistant/Office Manager with Healthcare Australia, a private employer, since 26-Oct-2024. She brings stability in her employment history, with prior roles in similar administrative capacities for over 4 years in the same and related industries. Her base salary is $95,000 p.a. ($7,916.67 per month), PAYG, not on probation.

There is no additional income such as rental, government benefits, or deductions noted beyond standard PAYG arrangements.

### Living Expenses

We have discussed with the clients their monthly living expenses after reviewing their budget and banking transaction history.

### Background

Alexia is in a strong position to purchase her first home and has demonstrated disciplined saving habits, with over $99,000 in her primary savings account prior to settlement and total assets of approximately $198,000 including superannuation, vehicles, and contents. She has no ongoing liabilities and no credit card or personal loan balances, nor history of arrears or defaults. Her employment is stable, with ongoing full-time PAYG income in the healthcare sector.

The structure featuring both variable and fixed-rate splits has been selected following clear discussions about her needs for repayment stability and future flexibility. Access to an offset account and redraw functionality are integral to Alexia’s disciplined financial management and support her objective to repay the mortgage efficiently.

Alexia has been forthcoming and transparent about her circumstances and has replied ‘no’ to both:

* At this point in time, are you aware of any changes to your broader situation that may impact on your earning capacity?  
* Have you been advised of any changes to your employment circumstances or income levels that will affect your ability to meet any existing debts or expenses?

### Conditions

There are no outstanding debts or liabilities requiring consolidation or repayment as a condition of approval. All contributions to purchase are from genuine savings.

### Exit Strategy

#### Projected Position at Retirement

Alexia plans to retire at age 67, which is 29 years from now (current age: 39).  
- **Loan balance at retirement:**  
  With 30-year principal and interest repayments and a commitment to continue regular payments, the loan is scheduled to be fully repaid prior to retirement at age 67, assuming consistent repayments and no major additional borrowings or redraws.  
- **Projected property value at retirement:**  
  Purchase price: $510,000.  
  Assuming conservative annual capital growth of 3%, in 29 years:  
  $510,000 × (1.03^29) ≈ $1,220,000  
- **Projected superannuation balance at retirement:**  
  Current balance: $75,954  
  Assuming continued contributions of $9,025 p.a. (9.5% SG on $95,000), with a conservative annual growth rate of 5%:  
  Future Value = $75,954 × (1.05^29) + Annual Contribution × ((1.05^29 - 1)/0.05)  
  = $331,771 + $9,025 × 54.64 ≈ $475,000 + $492,800 ≈ $824,571  
  (Rounded to approximately $825,000 by age 67)  
- **Projected total equity position at retirement:**  
  Property equity: $1,220,000  
  Superannuation: $825,000  
  Motor Vehicle/Contents (assuming depreciation, likely minimal at that stage): approx. $5,000  
  Estimated total equity: ~$2,050,000  
- **Potential retirement income sources:**  
  - Superannuation pension or lump sum, approx. $825,000  
  - Potential Age Pension (subject to assessment)  
  - No debt servicing requirement (loan repaid prior to or at retirement)  

**Assumptions:**  
- 3% p.a. property growth, 5% p.a. super growth, no significant redraws or hardship events, sustained employment and super contributions consistent with current status, and standard living expenses.

#### Strategy

Alexia’s preferred exit strategy is to fully repay her mortgage prior to retirement through regular P&I repayments over a 30-year term. Her projected timeline enables the mortgage to be fully extinguished by age 68, aligning with her retirement target of 67, minimising risk of carrying debt into retirement. Should she find herself approaching retirement with a small remaining balance, Alexia could access a superannuation lump sum—projected to exceed $825,000—to clear any residual debt, maintaining a strong equity and income position thereafter.

If circumstances change and an alternative strategy is required in later life, conservative projections demonstrate Alexia will have significant equity in her property (est. $1.2M) and superannuation (est. $825,000), allowing her to comfortably consider either:  
- Selling and downsizing, unlocking a substantial equity buffer for living expenses; or  
- Drawing on superannuation for either lump-sum or income stream; or  
- Relying (if eligible) on Government pension support as needed.

On current trajectories, loan repayment is feasible and sustainable within the projected income and asset base. This aligns with responsible lending principles and demonstrates a sound and practical exit strategy for the proposed lending.
