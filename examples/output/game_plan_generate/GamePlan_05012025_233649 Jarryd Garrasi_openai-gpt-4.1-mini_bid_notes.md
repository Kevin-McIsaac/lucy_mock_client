**Approach**  
We have thoroughly assessed over 30 lenders across the Australian market to identify the most suitable lending solutions tailored to your specific financial needs and goals. After careful consideration, we narrowed the options to three potential lenders, focusing on those that offer competitive rates, low fees, and features aligned with your objectives. Your primary goal is to refinance your existing loan to secure a better deal with lower interest payments while maintaining flexibility and access to funds. You prefer a 30-year loan term to support your retirement strategy and seek principal and interest monthly repayments to minimize interest costs and build equity steadily. Additionally, you indicated a preference for a variable interest rate product with features such as an offset account and redraw facility to provide you with flexibility and capability to reduce interest costs and loan term if circumstances allow.

**Recommendation**  
We recommend proceeding with ANZ for your loan refinancing needs. The proposed solution is a single split loan of $565,000 over a 30-year term with principal and interest monthly repayments. The variable interest rate offered is 5.96% p.a., resulting in an initial monthly repayment of approximately $3,372.94. The loan includes an offset account feature (with a $10 monthly fee) to help reduce interest payable and allow you ready access to funds. A redraw facility is also included, enabling you to access any prepaid funds, thus supporting your goal of managing cash flow and potentially paying off the loan early. This structure balances reducing repayments now while allowing you flexibility to increase repayments or decrease the loan term over time.

**Rationale for Recommendation**  
This particular ANZ variable rate loan aligns well with your stated preferences and objectives:  
- Refinancing to a lower interest rate reduces your yearly interest cost significantly by around $2,700 compared to your current rate of 6.44%, freeing up cash flow.  
- The 30-year term fits your retirement planning, minimizing initial repayments while retaining the option to maintain your effective loan period closer to the existing 27 years via extra payments.  
- Principal and interest repayments build equity steadily and minimize total interest over the life of the loan, consistent with your desire to keep costs down.  
- A variable rate product provides repayment flexibility without penalties on extra payments, fitting your plan to pay down the loan before retirement and handling any market rate adjustments.  
- The offset account and redraw features enable you to maximize interest savings and maintain accessibility to funds, which you value highly.  
- The $2,000 cashback from ANZ assists with refinancing costs, further supporting your financial position.

**Compared Products**  
We considered two other variable rate options with similar terms and loan size:  
- Orange Advantage Variable at 5.89% p.a., with slightly lower monthly repayments around $3,347.61 and lower upfront fees but a higher total cost of $1,214,709.60 lifetime, mainly due to additional ongoing and discharge fees.  
- Member Package Variable at 5.94% p.a., with monthly repayments of about $3,365.70 but higher upfront and ongoing fees leading to a higher total cost ($1,224,102.00 lifetime).  

Although the Orange Advantage product offers a marginally lower rate and repayment, the overall cost benefits are minimal and it lacks the $2,000 cashback ANZ provides. The slightly higher fees and less favourable features on the other products (e.g., no offset account fees disclosure) also make them less aligned to your preferences for flexibility and cost efficiency. ANZ’s combination of competitive rate, cashback incentive, and flexible offset/redraw facilities better meets your current needs and future goals.

**Fees and charges**  
This ANZ loan carries no application, establishment, settlement, or ongoing annual fees aside from a $10 monthly fee for the offset account. This aligns well with your objective of minimizing fees and ongoing costs. Compared to other products considered, which have higher ongoing and discharge fees, ANZ’s fee structure supports your goal of cost-effective borrowing. Additionally, there is no Lenders Mortgage Insurance payable due to your low LVR (78.47%) and acceptable valuations, which avoids extra upfront costs. This comprehensive fee transparency and relatively low fee environment help ensure that the overall solution remains in your best financial interest.
